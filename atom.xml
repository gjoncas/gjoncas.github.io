    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time we had a new result in semiotics? Itâ€™s a rite of passage in the humanities to write papers full of â€˜signifiersâ€™ and â€˜signifiedsâ€™, and later to problematize this model (Derrida, D&amp;G), but the approach is largely set in stone. Itâ€™s a deep shame: if only semiotics had advanced on a par with linguistics, many fields such as human-computer interaction could have progressed far more.</p>
<p>If anyone can remedy this, Joseph Goguen (1941-2006) is the guy for the job. His remarkably prolific research includes categorical fuzzy set theory, inventing the OBJ family of programming languages (e.g. CafeOBJ, Maude), and creating the theory of â€˜institutionsâ€™ as invariant properties of all logical systems. He was also a practicing Buddhist, and editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Consciousness Studies</em>.</p>
<p>All these come together in Goguenâ€™s algebraic semiotics, which uses category theory to formalize the notion of sign-system, serving as a principled approach to user interface design. The rabbit-hole goes quite deep, and the main ideas are strewn throughout numerous papers. This post gives a self-contained introduction to algebraic semiotics, outlining semiotic morphisms as mappings between sign-systems, conceptual blending as condensation of morphisms, hidden algebra as formalizing dynamic creation of meaning, and polymorphic poetics as computational semiology.</p>
<h3 id="sign-systems">Sign-Systems</h3>
<p>The key insight of semiotics is that instead of meaning being inherent to a sign, signs acquire meaning differentially, through a system of oppositions. Naturally, we donâ€™t want to spell these out, which for <em>n</em> signs implies <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> oppositions. If we used sets as a framework, we would be in for a rough time, not least because our understandings are always only partial â€” this wouldnâ€™t leave room for signs we donâ€™t know about, or may not want to include (1999: 250).</p>
<p>Instead, an approach using algebra gives the structure we need while also allowing open systems. Goguen gives a formal definition of a sign-system that Iâ€™ll explain in detail, so the reader may want to just skim until the next section. A sign-system is made of the following ingredients (2004: 4):</p>
<ol>
<li>
a <strong>signature</strong> that declares sorts, subsorts, and operations
</li>
<li>
a subsignature of data sorts and data functions
</li>
<li>
a set of <strong>axioms</strong> (e.g. equations) that act as constraints
</li>
<li>
a <strong>level ordering</strong> on sorts, including a maximal ordering called â€˜topâ€™
</li>
<li>
a <strong>priority ordering</strong> on constructors at the same level
</li>
</ol>
<p>First, a â€˜sortâ€™ is the type of a sign. It can be mundane, like separating text from numbers, but can also be elaborate, such as components of a multimedia display, with nested subsorts and supersorts. Sorts have a part-whole hierarchy (â€˜level orderingâ€™): for example a menu bar and scroll bar may be on the same level, but at a lower level than the window of which they are parts (Harrell, 2013: 133).</p>
<p>Operations include constructors that build new signs from old signs as parts, and selectors that pull out parts from compound signs (2004: 4). Constructors can have parameters, such an image of a cat that takes parameters for its color, size, and location (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 86); each parameter of a constructor has a corresponding selector to extract its value (1999: 263). These more standard attributes of signs (e.g. colors, booleans, integers) are â€˜data sortsâ€™, and go in the subsignature.</p>
<p>Axioms are logical formulas made of constructors, functions and predicates, and constrain the set of possible signs (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 86). For example, we may want to stipulate that all windows on a screen are below a certain size, or that an integer has no leading zeros (Harrell, 2013: 132).</p>
<p>The first four items make an <em>algebraic theory</em>, which just means a declaration of symbols plus rules to restrict their use (1999: 244). This is what makes Goguenâ€™s semiotics â€˜algebraicâ€™. Sometimes he refers to a sign-system as a â€˜semiotic theoryâ€™, as opposed to a specific model (i.e. interpretation) that instantiates it. The class of models that satisfy a given theory is called its semiotic space (2003: 2).</p>
<p>Note that we add some extra structure through a priority ordering, which is assigned to constructors and their arguments to express the relative importance of the signs they build (2003: 2). Hence, â€œpriorities indicate the relative significance of subsigns at a given levelâ€ (2004: 4). The level and priority ordering are the main ways that social context is integrated into a model.</p>
<p>In sum: â€œSorts classify signs, operations construct signs, data sorts provide values for attributes of signs, and levels and priorities indicate saliencyâ€ (2001: 2).</p>
<h3 id="semiotic-morphisms">Semiotic Morphisms</h3>
<p>Any representation is a mapping from signified to signifier. A semiotic morphism is precisely this: a structure-preserving map from one sign-system to another. Instead of signifieds we have a source space, while instead of signifiers we have a target space. Understanding takes place as a process from target to source, while design proceeds from source to target (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 88).</p>
<p>Algebraic semiotics begins from the idea that we can evaluate and compare morphisms by how well they preserve structure. A good explanation or design is all about making it easy to translate from one system (e.g. words) to another (how to do something). The kinds of structure to be preserved from one sign-system to another are just the components mentioned before (Harrell, 2013: 147):</p>
<ul>
<li>
Constructor-preserving â€“ each contains all of the same elements
</li>
<li>
Function-preserving â€“ all operations are present in both spaces
</li>
<li>
Axiom-preserving â€“ both systems maintain the same rules
</li>
<li>
Level-preserving â€“ part-whole relationships are maintained
</li>
<li>
Priority-preserving â€“ relative importance of elements are the same
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence semiotic morphisms map sorts to sorts, subsorts to subsorts, constructors to constructors, and so on, from source to target (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 88). The sign-systems need not be exactly the same, but should have corresponding structure. That is, morphisms translate â€œfrom the <em>language</em> of one sign system to the language of another, instead of just translating the concrete signs in the modelsâ€ (1999: 256). Likewise, these mappings are partial, since we canâ€™t expect to keep every single element, and our level and priority orderings help us decide which losses matter.</p>
<p>Since much of design involves choosing to preserve one thing or the other, Goguen identified several principles through detailed psychological and linguistic <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED243463.pdf">experiments</a> (2001: 3):</p>
<ol>
<li>
It is more important to preserve structure than content
</li>
<li>
It is more important to preserve level than priority
</li>
<li>
Structure and content at lower levels should be sacrificed in favor of those at higher levels
</li>
<li>
Lower level constructors should be sacrificed in favor of higher level constructors
</li>
<li>
It is more important to preserve high-level sorts than priorities (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 96)
</li>
</ol>
<p>These results are definitely non-obvious, and allow a principled approach to many design problems otherwise lacking solid guidelines. While most design can be done well without algebraic semiotics, the formalism really shines in resolving difficult decisions (2001: 4). One example of these principles in action was designing a proof assistant to be more pedagogically-friendly, which found that â€œearly designsâ€¦were incorrect because the corresponding semiotic morphisms failed to preserve certain key constructorsâ€ (Goguen &amp; Lin, 2001: 31). In a setting like teaching where students have vastly different intuitions, it could pay off to take a more abstract view to accommodate everybody.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-blending">Conceptual Blending</h3>
<p>The easiest way to understand something we donâ€™t know is by analogy with something we do know. Once there were no words for â€˜computer virusâ€™ or â€˜roadkillâ€™, so we just blended existing concepts.</p>
<p>One way to think about analogy is â€˜conceptual spacesâ€™, formalized as sets of elements with relations among them. A blending is then just a mapping from one conceptual space to another. Metaphoric blends are slightly more interesting, in that they are asymmetric: in saying â€œthe sun is a kingâ€, we donâ€™t evoke every quality of a king (crown, taxes), only the most salient ones. The literature even identifies optimality principles to judge whether a blend is good or not (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 5).</p>
<p>This all sounds familiar. In fact, we can see that this framework is quite impoverished compared to semiotic morphisms: elements and relations are not typed, nor are there functions or axioms (ibid.).</p>
<p>Types, for instance, give us information like if a metaphor is a personification, or how â€˜far apartâ€™ are the elements being compared. Likewise, functions and axioms help account for structure, such as how a poetic meter blends with a rhyme scheme (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 51). Most interesting of all, this enriched â€˜structural blendingâ€™ can be elegantly formalized as pushouts in category theory.</p>
<center>
<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/conceptual-blending.png" />
</center>
<p>In the simplest case of conceptual blending we have a base space <em>G</em> (which stands for â€˜generic spaceâ€™) plus two input spaces ğ¼â‚ and ğ¼â‚‚. Here <em>G</em>,ğ¼â‚,ğ¼â‚‚ and their morphisms <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚, <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚‚ make up the â€˜input diagramâ€™. Likewise, a blendoid is a space <em>B</em> with morphisms ğ¼â‚â†’<em>B</em>, ğ¼â‚‚â†’<em>B</em> and <em>G</em>â†’<em>B</em> called injections. The main thing we want is symmetry, where each element of <em>G</em> gets mapped to the same element of <em>B</em> regardless of whether we choose <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚â†’<em>B</em>, <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚‚â†’<em>B</em>, or <em>G</em>â†’<em>B</em>, i.e. the diagram commutes.</p>
<p>In English: ğ¼â‚ and ğ¼â‚‚ are two things being compared, <em>G</em> is what they have in common, and a blend <em>B</em> should be consistent no matter what â€˜sideâ€™ you come from. The intuition behind pushouts is that â€œnothing can be added to or subtracted from such an optimal blendoid without violating consistency or simplicity in some wayâ€ (2004: 13). This is mostly abstract nonsense, so letâ€™s do an example.</p>
<center>
<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/houseboat.png" />
</center>
<p>Here we see a structural blend for the term â€˜houseboatâ€™, or a boat that is used as a house. The left circle is â€˜houseâ€™ (ğ¼â‚), the right circle is â€˜boatâ€™ (ğ¼â‚‚). The bottom circle is their common elements (<em>G</em>), namely that they include a person, and are on a certain medium. If you check ğ¼â‚ or ğ¼â‚‚, each gives specifics for its input. And of course, at the top we have the blend â€˜houseboatâ€™ (<em>B</em>). Note that for the object, person, and their relation, <em>B</em> combines from both inputs; yet, for the medium we only have â€˜waterâ€™ â€” which is fine, because we only need weak equality, where each element maps to another.</p>
<p>Still, we can imagine other possible mappings, like â€˜boathouseâ€™ (a shelter for a boat). Goguen actually had to create a new categorical concept for this (â€˜3/2-pushoutsâ€™), since the output is not unique. Still, ideally weâ€™d like to have rules so that a computer can tell which blends make sense and which donâ€™t.</p>
<p>Hence, Goguen &amp; Harrell (2005b) wrote a computer program to generate all possible blends for this example. To their surprise, thereâ€™s actually a lot â€” namely 2<sup><small>A</small></sup>P, where <em>A</em> is the number of axioms, and <em>P</em> is the number of primary blendoids. As far as I can tell, A=4 and P=3, giving 48 possible blendoids.</p>
<p>To narrow these down, they looked for optimality principles. The main challenge is that to automate these, they need to be fully formal, based on structure ather than meaning. Goguen &amp; Harrell (2004: 52-3) ultimately arrived at degrees of commutativity (i.e. how much the arrows are â€˜equalâ€™), degree of axiom preservation (i.e. how well blends follow the rules), and amount of type casting for constants (i.e. whether a blendoid has an unnatural type). Overall, theyâ€™re satisfied that these principles match our intuition of how much a blend seems â€˜boat-likeâ€™ or â€˜house-likeâ€™ (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 16).</p>
<p>This example was very simple, and it turns out we can further generalize from pushouts to colimits. Colimits â€œcapture the notion of â€˜putting togetherâ€™ objects to form larger objects, in a way that takes account of shared substructuresâ€ (2005: 62, fn. 14). They give an optimal blend in that â€œthey put some components together, identifying as little as possible, with nothing left over, and with nothing essentially new addedâ€ (1999: 279). As before, we weaken these to â€˜3/2-colimitsâ€™. In short, theyâ€™re a powerful tool both to combine meanings and to study the effect of context on meaning (1997: 12).</p>
<p>On the conceptual end, this formalism lets us think of â€˜styleâ€™ as a choice of blending principles, and gives us a new language for stylistics. Notably, many artistic works make use of <em>dis</em>optimization principles, creating original ideas by violating our expectations (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 56). More whimsically, Goguen curated a â€˜<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/zoo/">semiotic zoo</a>â€™ of bad design choices illustrating semiotic principles. (Unfortunately theyâ€™re all extremely â€™90s.) While these examples are evocative, we donâ€™t quite have a general theory â€” at least not until we extend our formalism to encompass sign-dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-algebra">Hidden Algebra</h3>
<p>The math of algebraic semiotics is closely related to formal verification, or proving that software is bug-free. One problem with this is that most code is written in a rush to meet deadlines, often with last-minute design changes, and just isnâ€™t worth the trouble of verifying. Sometimes we only want to know a design works (e.g. a cryptographic protocol) and leave the code up to the user. This is called formal specification, where we prove properties of <em>designs</em>, as opposed to code (1997: 10).</p>
<p>In a static design, we want to know the different parts and what they do, which is like an algebra with elements and operations. However, in dynamic designs an operator often depends on a <em>state</em> that changes over time. A nice example is <code>undo</code>, which goes back to the state before the last command, so the computer needs to have the last state on record, to access it if needed (1999: 272).</p>
<p>The motivation for hidden algebra was to formalize object-oriented software (Goguen &amp; Malcolm, 2000: 56), in which â€˜objectsâ€™ have various attributes put together (e.g. a personâ€™s name and height), visible to other objects. Each object also has a â€˜hiddenâ€™ internal state that other objects can modify through methods (functions). Thus we have a division between attributes that stay the same, and states that can change. Hidden algebra is all about handling both of these at once.</p>
<p>While visible attributes are easy to handle with algebra, we can only find out a state by performing an experiment on it. This leads naturally to the idea that two designs are â€˜equivalentâ€™ if they behave the same in all relevant experiments (Goguen &amp; Lin, 2000: 28). For example, practical software often doesnâ€™t follow its specification exactly, so we may want to prove whether this makes any difference (1997: 10). Likewise, this can help if want to simplify a UI design without losing functionality.</p>
<p>Classical semiotics takes signs as given, but in UI design we need to think about signs that change in response to user input, or that move on their own (2004: 22). Likewise, real-world sign systems are dynamic: words change their meaning, new words are introduced, old words disappear, and even syntax changes (1999: 272). Itâ€™s common to bash structuralism for being static, but without a formalism to explicitly express changing states, â€˜post-structuralistâ€™ semiotics is no better.</p>
<p>This form of analysis for behaviours of hidden states is called coalgebra, a â€˜dualâ€™ to normal algebra. Even ignoring the technical details, Goguen makes a strong case that any dynamic semiotics must be coalgebraic, and hidden algebraâ€™s strength comes precisely from combining algebra with coalgebra.</p>
<p>The most elaborate application so far has been Triantafyllou et al. (2014) using algebraic semiotics to measure quality of video annotations. Goguen envisioned a form of algebraic engineering for sign-systems (Goguen &amp; Malcolm, 1999: 164), and made impressive progress in laying its foundations. Still, for this to actually catch on, it should bring not only new formalisms, but also radical new ideas.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphic-poetics">Polymorphic Poetics</h3>
<p>Polypoems use algebraic semiotics in a generative way to create interactive artworks. Goguen was especially interested in computational narratology, so the term isnâ€™t limited to poetry by any means. One more poetic example is â€œ<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/projs/haibun05.html">November Qualia</a>â€, which is essentially a poem built from randomized phrases, much like Queneauâ€™s <em>Hundred Thousand Billion Poems</em>. Other proposed applications include computer games that generate a plot as they are played (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 49), computer-generated hip-hop (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 23), and various elaborate multimedia projects that â€” probably for the better â€” never materialized (Mamakos &amp; Stefaneas, 2013).</p>
<p>Conversely, polymorphic poetics is the use of algebraic semiotics as an analytical method, describing how choices of semiotic morphisms affect the expression of a work (Harrell, 2013: 150). In UI design, it â€œuses morphic semiotics to help describe how meaning â€˜gets intoâ€™ computing systemsâ€ (ibid., 117). Proposed applications include designing new media such as VR whose rules are not well-known, increasing usability of hardware, and supporting non-standard users such as people with disabilities (2004: 1-2). For the semiotically-inclined reader, this is probably the most compelling idea so far, but it was little developed before Goguenâ€™s unexpected death from illness in 2016.</p>
<p>Some hints are there about what polymorphic poetics might have looked like if better theorized. Sadly, itâ€™s clear that Goguen never engaged with semiotics at a graduate level. His general idea of Peirce was that he had a triadic system of signifier, signified, and an interpretant that links these two. He sees Saussure as having a more dyadic system of signifier vs. signified, but his major insight is that signs occur in sign-systems (1999: 244-5). Goguen frames his approach as similar to Peirce, whose semiotic triangle is â€˜relationalâ€™, as opposed to the â€˜functionalâ€™ view of Saussure (2003: 7).</p>
<p>An evocative illustration of the potential for algebraic semiotics is the idea that art functions through non-preservation of structure and violation of axioms (Harrell, 2004: 148). With a large enough corpus, we can imagine establishing â€˜meta-rulesâ€™ of when a violation is acceptable â€” and these, perhaps, get violated in turn. Note, however, that algebraic semiotics is less a school of thought on its own, and more a tool to formalize diverse readings, ensuring consistency and revealing structure.</p>
<p>In a fascinating paper, Goguen &amp; Borgo (2005) model free-jazz performances as nonlinear dynamical systems, where improvisation enacts the complex dynamics of musical phase space. ChiriÅ£Äƒ &amp; Fiadiero (2016) framed this through the lens of algebraic semiotics, creating a logic for free jazz that can be used to evaluate how it meets listenersâ€™ expectations, find which music fragments are hardly reachable, and predict how an improvisation will evolve. This is by far the most impressive extension of algebraic semiotics thus far, and shows the deep richness that formal methods can bring.</p>
<p>A truly scientific theory of signs would have vast consequences for every field. For Goguen (2005), the ultimate scope of his project was a â€˜unified concept theoryâ€™ using his theory of institutions to raise algebraic semiotics into a rigorous theory of knowledge representation, superseding formal concept analysis. These claims sound grandiose to the point of being crankish, but by now I hope the reader has seen that Goguen was perhaps the single person who could realistically deliver on this.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s clear that the tools are in place for a formal science of signs. Goguenâ€™s algebraic semiotics was developed with working examples implemented in OBJ code. The main barrier has simply been that experts in semiotics have ever even heard of ideas like colimits or universal algebra. Again, all of this is realizable right now â€” all thatâ€™s missing is someone willing to do the dirty work.</p>
<p>Radical ideas like â€˜cognitive ergonomicsâ€™ are often tossed around for selling snake oil, but Goguen opens up the tantalizing thought that foundations for this could truly exist. We can speculate on an algebraic semiotics software added to design workflows like a debugger, optimizing user experience and potentially avoiding disastrous design flaws. We can imagine a semiotic branch of numerous sciences, such as computational biosemiotics giving us algebraic models of animal communication.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, semiotics is used as an academic acrolect to ensure that people can â€˜talk the talkâ€™, as well as dressing up insipid research to sound radical and profound. Itâ€™s time for semiotics to finally live up to its potential, as the kind of unified theory that gives post-structuralists nightmares.</p>

<p>When was the last time we had a new result in semiotics? Itâ€™s a rite of passage in the humanities to write papers full of â€˜signifiersâ€™ and â€˜signifiedsâ€™, and later to problematize this model (Derrida, D&amp;G), but the approach is largely set in stone. Itâ€™s a deep shame: if only semiotics had advanced on a par with linguistics, many fields such as human-computer interaction could have progressed far more.</p>
<p>If anyone can remedy this, Joseph Goguen (1941-2006) is the guy for the job. His remarkably prolific research includes categorical fuzzy set theory, inventing the OBJ family of programming languages (e.g. CafeOBJ, Maude), and creating the theory of â€˜institutionsâ€™ as invariant properties of all logical systems. He was also a practicing Buddhist, and editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Consciousness Studies</em>.</p>
<p>All these come together in Goguenâ€™s algebraic semiotics, which uses category theory to formalize the notion of sign-system, serving as a principled approach to user interface design. The rabbit-hole goes quite deep, and the main ideas are strewn throughout numerous papers. This post gives a self-contained introduction to algebraic semiotics, outlining semiotic morphisms as mappings between sign-systems, conceptual blending as condensation of morphisms, hidden algebra as formalizing dynamic creation of meaning, and polymorphic poetics as computational semiology.</p>
<h3 id="sign-systems">Sign-Systems</h3>
<p>The key insight of semiotics is that instead of meaning being inherent to a sign, signs acquire meaning differentially, through a system of oppositions. Naturally, we donâ€™t want to spell these out, which for <em>n</em> signs implies <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> oppositions. If we used sets as a framework, we would be in for a rough time, not least because our understandings are always only partial â€” this wouldnâ€™t leave room for signs we donâ€™t know about, or may not want to include (1999: 250).</p>
<p>Instead, an approach using algebra gives the structure we need while also allowing open systems. Goguen gives a formal definition of a sign-system that Iâ€™ll explain in detail, so the reader may want to just skim until the next section. A sign-system is made of the following ingredients (2004: 4):</p>
<ol>
<li>a <strong>signature</strong> that declares sorts, subsorts, and operations</li>
<li>a subsignature of data sorts and data functions</li>
<li>a set of <strong>axioms</strong> (e.g. equations) that act as constraints</li>
<li>a <strong>level ordering</strong> on sorts, including a maximal ordering called â€˜topâ€™</li>
<li>a <strong>priority ordering</strong> on constructors at the same level</li>
</ol>
<p>First, a â€˜sortâ€™ is the type of a sign. It can be mundane, like separating text from numbers, but can also be elaborate, such as components of a multimedia display, with nested subsorts and supersorts. Sorts have a part-whole hierarchy (â€˜level orderingâ€™): for example a menu bar and scroll bar may be on the same level, but at a lower level than the window of which they are parts (Harrell, 2013: 133).</p>
<p>Operations include constructors that build new signs from old signs as parts, and selectors that pull out parts from compound signs (2004: 4). Constructors can have parameters, such an image of a cat that takes parameters for its color, size, and location (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 86); each parameter of a constructor has a corresponding selector to extract its value (1999: 263). These more standard attributes of signs (e.g. colors, booleans, integers) are â€˜data sortsâ€™, and go in the subsignature.</p>
<p>Axioms are logical formulas made of constructors, functions and predicates, and constrain the set of possible signs (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 86). For example, we may want to stipulate that all windows on a screen are below a certain size, or that an integer has no leading zeros (Harrell, 2013: 132).</p>
<p>The first four items make an <em>algebraic theory</em>, which just means a declaration of symbols plus rules to restrict their use (1999: 244). This is what makes Goguenâ€™s semiotics â€˜algebraicâ€™. Sometimes he refers to a sign-system as a â€˜semiotic theoryâ€™, as opposed to a specific model (i.e. interpretation) that instantiates it. The class of models that satisfy a given theory is called its semiotic space (2003: 2).</p>
<p>Note that we add some extra structure through a priority ordering, which is assigned to constructors and their arguments to express the relative importance of the signs they build (2003: 2). Hence, â€œpriorities indicate the relative significance of subsigns at a given levelâ€ (2004: 4). The level and priority ordering are the main ways that social context is integrated into a model.</p>
<p>In sum: â€œSorts classify signs, operations construct signs, data sorts provide values for attributes of signs, and levels and priorities indicate saliencyâ€ (2001: 2).</p>
<h3 id="semiotic-morphisms">Semiotic Morphisms</h3>
<p>Any representation is a mapping from signified to signifier. A semiotic morphism is precisely this: a structure-preserving map from one sign-system to another. Instead of signifieds we have a source space, while instead of signifiers we have a target space. Understanding takes place as a process from target to source, while design proceeds from source to target (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 88).</p>
<p>Algebraic semiotics begins from the idea that we can evaluate and compare morphisms by how well they preserve structure. A good explanation or design is all about making it easy to translate from one system (e.g. words) to another (how to do something). The kinds of structure to be preserved from one sign-system to another are just the components mentioned before (Harrell, 2013: 147):</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructor-preserving â€“ each contains all of the same elements</li>
<li>Function-preserving â€“ all operations are present in both spaces</li>
<li>Axiom-preserving â€“ both systems maintain the same rules</li>
<li>Level-preserving â€“ part-whole relationships are maintained</li>
<li>Priority-preserving â€“ relative importance of elements are the same</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence semiotic morphisms map sorts to sorts, subsorts to subsorts, constructors to constructors, and so on, from source to target (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 88). The sign-systems need not be exactly the same, but should have corresponding structure. That is, morphisms translate â€œfrom the <em>language</em> of one sign system to the language of another, instead of just translating the concrete signs in the modelsâ€ (1999: 256). Likewise, these mappings are partial, since we canâ€™t expect to keep every single element, and our level and priority orderings help us decide which losses matter.</p>
<p>Since much of design involves choosing to preserve one thing or the other, Goguen identified several principles through detailed psychological and linguistic <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED243463.pdf">experiments</a> (2001: 3):</p>
<ol>
<li>It is more important to preserve structure than content</li>
<li>It is more important to preserve level than priority</li>
<li>Structure and content at lower levels should be sacrificed in favor of those at higher levels</li>
<li>Lower level constructors should be sacrificed in favor of higher level constructors</li>
<li>It is more important to preserve high-level sorts than priorities (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005a: 96)</li>
</ol>
<p>These results are definitely non-obvious, and allow a principled approach to many design problems otherwise lacking solid guidelines. While most design can be done well without algebraic semiotics, the formalism really shines in resolving difficult decisions (2001: 4). One example of these principles in action was designing a proof assistant to be more pedagogically-friendly, which found that â€œearly designsâ€¦were incorrect because the corresponding semiotic morphisms failed to preserve certain key constructorsâ€ (Goguen &amp; Lin, 2001: 31). In a setting like teaching where students have vastly different intuitions, it could pay off to take a more abstract view to accommodate everybody.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-blending">Conceptual Blending</h3>
<p>The easiest way to understand something we donâ€™t know is by analogy with something we do know. Once there were no words for â€˜computer virusâ€™ or â€˜roadkillâ€™, so we just blended existing concepts.</p>
<p>One way to think about analogy is â€˜conceptual spacesâ€™, formalized as sets of elements with relations among them. A blending is then just a mapping from one conceptual space to another. Metaphoric blends are slightly more interesting, in that they are asymmetric: in saying â€œthe sun is a kingâ€, we donâ€™t evoke every quality of a king (crown, taxes), only the most salient ones. The literature even identifies optimality principles to judge whether a blend is good or not (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 5).</p>
<p>This all sounds familiar. In fact, we can see that this framework is quite impoverished compared to semiotic morphisms: elements and relations are not typed, nor are there functions or axioms (ibid.).</p>
<p>Types, for instance, give us information like if a metaphor is a personification, or how â€˜far apartâ€™ are the elements being compared. Likewise, functions and axioms help account for structure, such as how a poetic meter blends with a rhyme scheme (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 51). Most interesting of all, this enriched â€˜structural blendingâ€™ can be elegantly formalized as pushouts in category theory.</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/conceptual-blending.png" />
</center>
<p>In the simplest case of conceptual blending we have a base space <em>G</em> (which stands for â€˜generic spaceâ€™) plus two input spaces ğ¼â‚ and ğ¼â‚‚. Here <em>G</em>,ğ¼â‚,ğ¼â‚‚ and their morphisms <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚, <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚‚ make up the â€˜input diagramâ€™. Likewise, a blendoid is a space <em>B</em> with morphisms ğ¼â‚â†’<em>B</em>, ğ¼â‚‚â†’<em>B</em> and <em>G</em>â†’<em>B</em> called injections. The main thing we want is symmetry, where each element of <em>G</em> gets mapped to the same element of <em>B</em> regardless of whether we choose <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚â†’<em>B</em>, <em>G</em>â†’ğ¼â‚‚â†’<em>B</em>, or <em>G</em>â†’<em>B</em>, i.e. the diagram commutes.</p>
<p>In English: ğ¼â‚ and ğ¼â‚‚ are two things being compared, <em>G</em> is what they have in common, and a blend <em>B</em> should be consistent no matter what â€˜sideâ€™ you come from. The intuition behind pushouts is that â€œnothing can be added to or subtracted from such an optimal blendoid without violating consistency or simplicity in some wayâ€ (2004: 13). This is mostly abstract nonsense, so letâ€™s do an example.</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/houseboat.png" />
</center>
<p>Here we see a structural blend for the term â€˜houseboatâ€™, or a boat that is used as a house. The left circle is â€˜houseâ€™ (ğ¼â‚), the right circle is â€˜boatâ€™ (ğ¼â‚‚). The bottom circle is their common elements (<em>G</em>), namely that they include a person, and are on a certain medium. If you check ğ¼â‚ or ğ¼â‚‚, each gives specifics for its input. And of course, at the top we have the blend â€˜houseboatâ€™ (<em>B</em>). Note that for the object, person, and their relation, <em>B</em> combines from both inputs; yet, for the medium we only have â€˜waterâ€™ â€” which is fine, because we only need weak equality, where each element maps to another.</p>
<p>Still, we can imagine other possible mappings, like â€˜boathouseâ€™ (a shelter for a boat). Goguen actually had to create a new categorical concept for this (â€˜3/2-pushoutsâ€™), since the output is not unique. Still, ideally weâ€™d like to have rules so that a computer can tell which blends make sense and which donâ€™t.</p>
<p>Hence, Goguen &amp; Harrell (2005b) wrote a computer program to generate all possible blends for this example. To their surprise, thereâ€™s actually a lot â€” namely 2<sup><small>A</small></sup>P, where <em>A</em> is the number of axioms, and <em>P</em> is the number of primary blendoids. As far as I can tell, A=4 and P=3, giving 48 possible blendoids.</p>
<p>To narrow these down, they looked for optimality principles. The main challenge is that to automate these, they need to be fully formal, based on structure ather than meaning. Goguen &amp; Harrell (2004: 52-3) ultimately arrived at degrees of commutativity (i.e. how much the arrows are â€˜equalâ€™), degree of axiom preservation (i.e. how well blends follow the rules), and amount of type casting for constants (i.e. whether a blendoid has an unnatural type). Overall, theyâ€™re satisfied that these principles match our intuition of how much a blend seems â€˜boat-likeâ€™ or â€˜house-likeâ€™ (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 16).</p>
<p>This example was very simple, and it turns out we can further generalize from pushouts to colimits. Colimits â€œcapture the notion of â€˜putting togetherâ€™ objects to form larger objects, in a way that takes account of shared substructuresâ€ (2005: 62, fn. 14). They give an optimal blend in that â€œthey put some components together, identifying as little as possible, with nothing left over, and with nothing essentially new addedâ€ (1999: 279). As before, we weaken these to â€˜3/2-colimitsâ€™. In short, theyâ€™re a powerful tool both to combine meanings and to study the effect of context on meaning (1997: 12).</p>
<p>On the conceptual end, this formalism lets us think of â€˜styleâ€™ as a choice of blending principles, and gives us a new language for stylistics. Notably, many artistic works make use of <em>dis</em>optimization principles, creating original ideas by violating our expectations (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 56). More whimsically, Goguen curated a â€˜<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/zoo/">semiotic zoo</a>â€™ of bad design choices illustrating semiotic principles. (Unfortunately theyâ€™re all extremely â€™90s.) While these examples are evocative, we donâ€™t quite have a general theory â€” at least not until we extend our formalism to encompass sign-dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="hidden-algebra">Hidden Algebra</h3>
<p>The math of algebraic semiotics is closely related to formal verification, or proving that software is bug-free. One problem with this is that most code is written in a rush to meet deadlines, often with last-minute design changes, and just isnâ€™t worth the trouble of verifying. Sometimes we only want to know a design works (e.g. a cryptographic protocol) and leave the code up to the user. This is called formal specification, where we prove properties of <em>designs</em>, as opposed to code (1997: 10).</p>
<p>In a static design, we want to know the different parts and what they do, which is like an algebra with elements and operations. However, in dynamic designs an operator often depends on a <em>state</em> that changes over time. A nice example is <code>undo</code>, which goes back to the state before the last command, so the computer needs to have the last state on record, to access it if needed (1999: 272).</p>
<p>The motivation for hidden algebra was to formalize object-oriented software (Goguen &amp; Malcolm, 2000: 56), in which â€˜objectsâ€™ have various attributes put together (e.g. a personâ€™s name and height), visible to other objects. Each object also has a â€˜hiddenâ€™ internal state that other objects can modify through methods (functions). Thus we have a division between attributes that stay the same, and states that can change. Hidden algebra is all about handling both of these at once.</p>
<p>While visible attributes are easy to handle with algebra, we can only find out a state by performing an experiment on it. This leads naturally to the idea that two designs are â€˜equivalentâ€™ if they behave the same in all relevant experiments (Goguen &amp; Lin, 2000: 28). For example, practical software often doesnâ€™t follow its specification exactly, so we may want to prove whether this makes any difference (1997: 10). Likewise, this can help if want to simplify a UI design without losing functionality.</p>
<p>Classical semiotics takes signs as given, but in UI design we need to think about signs that change in response to user input, or that move on their own (2004: 22). Likewise, real-world sign systems are dynamic: words change their meaning, new words are introduced, old words disappear, and even syntax changes (1999: 272). Itâ€™s common to bash structuralism for being static, but without a formalism to explicitly express changing states, â€˜post-structuralistâ€™ semiotics is no better.</p>
<p>This form of analysis for behaviours of hidden states is called coalgebra, a â€˜dualâ€™ to normal algebra. Even ignoring the technical details, Goguen makes a strong case that any dynamic semiotics must be coalgebraic, and hidden algebraâ€™s strength comes precisely from combining algebra with coalgebra.</p>
<p>The most elaborate application so far has been Triantafyllou et al. (2014) using algebraic semiotics to measure quality of video annotations. Goguen envisioned a form of algebraic engineering for sign-systems (Goguen &amp; Malcolm, 1999: 164), and made impressive progress in laying its foundations. Still, for this to actually catch on, it should bring not only new formalisms, but also radical new ideas.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphic-poetics">Polymorphic Poetics</h3>
<p>Polypoems use algebraic semiotics in a generative way to create interactive artworks. Goguen was especially interested in computational narratology, so the term isnâ€™t limited to poetry by any means. One more poetic example is â€œ<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~goguen/projs/haibun05.html">November Qualia</a>â€, which is essentially a poem built from randomized phrases, much like Queneauâ€™s <em>Hundred Thousand Billion Poems</em>. Other proposed applications include computer games that generate a plot as they are played (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2004: 49), computer-generated hip-hop (Goguen &amp; Harrell, 2005b: 23), and various elaborate multimedia projects that â€” probably for the better â€” never materialized (Mamakos &amp; Stefaneas, 2013).</p>
<p>Conversely, polymorphic poetics is the use of algebraic semiotics as an analytical method, describing how choices of semiotic morphisms affect the expression of a work (Harrell, 2013: 150). In UI design, it â€œuses morphic semiotics to help describe how meaning â€˜gets intoâ€™ computing systemsâ€ (ibid., 117). Proposed applications include designing new media such as VR whose rules are not well-known, increasing usability of hardware, and supporting non-standard users such as people with disabilities (2004: 1-2). For the semiotically-inclined reader, this is probably the most compelling idea so far, but it was little developed before Goguenâ€™s unexpected death from illness in 2016.</p>
<p>Some hints are there about what polymorphic poetics might have looked like if better theorized. Sadly, itâ€™s clear that Goguen never engaged with semiotics at a graduate level. His general idea of Peirce was that he had a triadic system of signifier, signified, and an interpretant that links these two. He sees Saussure as having a more dyadic system of signifier vs. signified, but his major insight is that signs occur in sign-systems (1999: 244-5). Goguen frames his approach as similar to Peirce, whose semiotic triangle is â€˜relationalâ€™, as opposed to the â€˜functionalâ€™ view of Saussure (2003: 7).</p>
<p>An evocative illustration of the potential for algebraic semiotics is the idea that art functions through non-preservation of structure and violation of axioms (Harrell, 2004: 148). With a large enough corpus, we can imagine establishing â€˜meta-rulesâ€™ of when a violation is acceptable â€” and these, perhaps, get violated in turn. Note, however, that algebraic semiotics is less a school of thought on its own, and more a tool to formalize diverse readings, ensuring consistency and revealing structure.</p>
<p>In a fascinating paper, Goguen &amp; Borgo (2005) model free-jazz performances as nonlinear dynamical systems, where improvisation enacts the complex dynamics of musical phase space. ChiriÅ£Äƒ &amp; Fiadiero (2016) framed this through the lens of algebraic semiotics, creating a logic for free jazz that can be used to evaluate how it meets listenersâ€™ expectations, find which music fragments are hardly reachable, and predict how an improvisation will evolve. This is by far the most impressive extension of algebraic semiotics thus far, and shows the deep richness that formal methods can bring.</p>
<p>A truly scientific theory of signs would have vast consequences for every field. For Goguen (2005), the ultimate scope of his project was a â€˜unified concept theoryâ€™ using his theory of institutions to raise algebraic semiotics into a rigorous theory of knowledge representation, superseding formal concept analysis. These claims sound grandiose to the point of being crankish, but by now I hope the reader has seen that Goguen was perhaps the single person who could realistically deliver on this.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s clear that the tools are in place for a formal science of signs. Goguenâ€™s algebraic semiotics was developed with working examples implemented in OBJ code. The main barrier has simply been that experts in semiotics have ever even heard of ideas like colimits or universal algebra. Again, all of this is realizable right now â€” all thatâ€™s missing is someone willing to do the dirty work.</p>
<p>Radical ideas like â€˜cognitive ergonomicsâ€™ are often tossed around for selling snake oil, but Goguen opens up the tantalizing thought that foundations for this could truly exist. We can speculate on an algebraic semiotics software added to design workflows like a debugger, optimizing user experience and potentially avoiding disastrous design flaws. We can imagine a semiotic branch of numerous sciences, such as computational biosemiotics giving us algebraic models of animal communication.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, semiotics is used as an academic acrolect to ensure that people can â€˜talk the talkâ€™, as well as dressing up insipid research to sound radical and profound. Itâ€™s time for semiotics to finally live up to its potential, as the kind of unified theory that gives post-structuralists nightmares.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Sallach is a mathematical sociologist at Argonne National Laboratory, and senior fellow at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Computation Institute. Over the past decade he has researched category theory as a foundation for computational social science, with topos theory as his main framework.</p>
<p>In philosophy circles, topos theory is best known as the machinery behind Badiouâ€™s <em>Logics of Worlds</em>. It is often brought up by Zalamea, who outlines how the closely-related sheaf theory opens up novel relations between local and global that philosophy should take up in turn. Yet, due to the obvious barriers to entry, most attempts at this have just been exercises in hand-waving.</p>
<p>This post aims to give a general overview of Sallachâ€™s research project, from the preliminary concepts it started with, onward to the process of narrowing down among competing frameworks, and finally to the new ideas that topos theory can bring for social analysis. I assure you, I am in no position to talk about these things, but no-one else is going to do it, so what the heck.</p>
<h3 id="categorical-sociology">Categorical Sociology</h3>
<p>Sallach comes from a background in computational social science, which at this point is essentially a hodgepodge of agent-based simulations and social network modelling. While itâ€™s possible to make highly practical models, lack of underlying theory makes it very hard to draw general conclusions.</p>
<p>An obvious reason why category theory suggests itself is its potential to tie together many disparate formalisms currently in use. Culture is a network of networks, where social distinctions create ingroups and outgroups, with an associated core and periphery (2011: 7). The main unit here is discrete agents, but itâ€™s also natural to think of macro-level trends as if they were continuous.</p>
<p>Curiously, a major part of Sallachâ€™s initial metaphors come from topological quantum field theory. Rather than quantitative metrics, here we are interested in topology change, a far more â€˜qualitativeâ€™ kind of reasoning, much like how we think of transforming social structures. We want to analyze degrees of freedom as capacities for variation, and how changes propagate through them (2011: 10).</p>
<p>Similarly, it seldom makes sense to say that two social tendencies are â€˜equalâ€™ in a mathematical way, and a major benefit of categories is to allow weaker forms of equality. Objects in a category are specified only â€˜up to isomorphismâ€™, where instead of spelling out how two things are the same, they are simply taken as indistinguishable. Further, if two things are equivalent up to isomorphism, these equivalences can likewise be equivalent from the point of view of a higher category, in a â€œrecursive weakening of the notion of uniquenessâ€ (Baez &amp; Dolan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9802029.pdf">1998</a>), allowing various levels of granularity.</p>
<p>However, categorical objects tend to be viewed as invariants, of which there are few in the social world â€” death and taxes excepted. To get around this problem, for Sallach the main objects of categorical social theory are ideal types, never appearing in pure form empirically (2012a: 12).</p>
<p>Sallach extends this notion of ideal type by drawing from Karl Popperâ€™s propensity interpretation of probability. The paradigmatic example here is rolling a die: we know the odds of getting a given side are 1 in 6, but frequentist probability must justify this through a complex rigmarole of supposing an infinite sequence of dice rolls that would solidify these probabilities. Itâ€™s far more cogent to say these probabilities are built into the structure of the die (6 equal sides, etc.). Thus: â€œPropensity measures the causal pressure exerted by certain conditions toward the realization of certain eventsâ€ (2011: 11).</p>
<p>Especially in contexts like quantum theory, we want to talk about the chances of an atom decaying, even though it will decay only once â€” i.e. single-case statistics. Analogously, we also want to be talk about probability in the case of broad social tendencies whose conditions can never be replicated again. Hence, Urbach (1980) extends the notion of propensity in a direction that Popper himself would have hated, to encompass the holistic forces dealt with in sociology. His key example is Durkheimâ€™s study of suicide, which found a remarkable persistence in suicide rates irrespective of mortality rates, with equally-persisting discontinuities across state and demographic boundaries.</p>
<p>Because â€˜propensityâ€™ is such an underdetermined concept, it applies to vastly different social fields and forces, making it ideal for the level of abstraction in category theory (2012b: 7-8); in fact, a metaphorical inspiration here is quantum spin networks (2011: 11). The next step is to find morphisms <em>g</em>: A â‡’ B, i.e. processes carrying a system from state A to state B (2011: 10). The wealth of categorical abstractions lets us express dynamics subject to local entanglements, as actorsâ€™ endogenous behaviour gives rise to emergent structure.</p>
<p>In sum, the appeal of category theory in social science is to bridge continuous and discrete patterns, and allow â€˜calibrated generalizationâ€™ of social transformations rather than strict equality (2012b: 2). Most of all it offers a form of recursive locality, giving a unified way to analyze bottom-up emergent effects of aggregated agents, plus top-down structural effects on micro-level decisions (2012b: 6).</p>
<h3 id="social-homotopy-types">Social Homotopy Types</h3>
<p>In 2013, some of the greatest mathematicians in the world published a new foundations of mathematics: homotopy type theory. Naturally, this is exciting stuff, which led Sallach into a detour to see how HoTT might bear upon social science. I feel like not much actually came out of this project, but itâ€™s still worth seeing how he went about it.</p>
<p>Type theory originated in response to a paradox in the foundations of mathematics. Russellâ€™s paradox runs: if a barber shaves everyone who doesnâ€™t shave himself, who shaves the barber? If he does, he doesnâ€™t; if he doesnâ€™t he does. The paradox extends to set theory, at that time the main building block for all mathematics. Russell &amp; Whiteheadâ€™s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> used type theory to circumvent it. Imagine a village with a system of castes <strong>1</strong>,<strong>2</strong>,<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong>, where <strong>4</strong> is higher than <strong>3</strong>, <strong>3</strong> than <strong>2</strong>, <strong>2</strong> than <strong>1</strong>. A person may only be shaved by someone of a lower caste (e.g. a <strong>3</strong> by a <strong>2</strong> or <strong>1</strong>). Since there is no self-shaving, there is no paradox (Doxiadis &amp; Papadimitriou, 2009: 174-5).</p>
<p>In this sense, type theory refutes the claim that â€œeverything is a setâ€ (de Bruijn, 1995: 28). However, until quite recently it was unclear just how the two differ. One property peculiar to types is that â€œany definable property of objects is invariantâ€ (Awodey, 2014: 7). The solution, it turns out, is to view types as <em>spaces</em>, and examine them with a branch of math that concentrates on spaces: topology.</p>
<p>Topology is the mathematics of squishing shapes into other shapes. A well-known result is that, squish as you might, a sphere canâ€™t be made into a doughnut without tearing it. That is, there exist invariants to the squishability of shapes. If a shape is only a squish or two away from another shape â€” that is, there exists a <em>homotopy</em> between the two â€” the shapes are â€˜homotopy equivalentâ€™.</p>
<p>To put this more formally, if <strong>T</strong> is a topological space, then two elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <strong>T</strong> are identical if <strong>T</strong> has a continuous path from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> (Leslie-Hurd &amp; Haworth, 2013: 101). Given functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> mapping <strong>T</strong> onto another space <strong>U</strong>, a homotopy morphs one map into another. This means that a homotopy can â€œcleanly lift the notion of identity from elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em>â€ (ibid.).</p>
<p>HoTT closely corresponds to <em>n</em>-category theory, which uses layers of categories to leverage weak equivalences, thereby incorporating greater complexity (2012a: 14). The appeal of HoTT for social science is the high expressiveness afforded by its higher-order logic, which allows (2014: 2):</p>
<ol>
<li>
an ability to customize equivalences,
</li>
<li>
a means of demarcating discourse boundaries, and
</li>
<li>
creation of specialized spaces and shapes to which social processes can be mapped.
</li>
</ol>
<p>While the notion of isomorphism lets us ignore all the quantitative details of social transfomation, HoTT can talk about this topologically. Identity in HoTT means two objects are the same homotopy type, so their transformations through deformation will be isomorphic; social interaction can thereby be seen as progession along one such path (2014: 6). It also lets us attribute agency to these transformations by means of type constructors: â€œa social actor can be an elicitor, a role in which one seeks to alter the motive pattern of another, and thus change the otherâ€™s social typeâ€ (2014: 8).</p>
<p>One last interesting detail about HoTT is that it can be used as a proof language to formally verify theorems. Thus it lends itself to axiomatic approaches to social science, such as that attempted in Austrian economics. Given social scientistsâ€™ well-known inability to agree on even the simplest of terms, the odds seem stacked against such a project. Still, perhaps such a highly abstract language can identify common ground among seemingly incommensurate approaches, such as the following otherworldly axioms (2016a: 8):</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Axiom 4a</strong>. The more directly that the path of a social actor or cultural trend approaches an idealized conceptual pole, the higher is the n-category required to characterize its structure.<br><br> <strong>Axiom 5</strong>. The more rapidly a social actor or cultural trend approaches an idealized conceptual pole, the more morphisms it manifests.
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Sallach prefers to use HoTT metaphorically, mapping from qualitative social concepts to mathematical ones. Yet, Iâ€™d be far more impressed if he approached it from a quantitative angle, showing how one well-known model in the social sciences topologically morphs into another. Still, given its Rosetta stone-like translation into categories, HoTT may prove to be a powerful tool for implementing categorical social science, by means of tools such as cubical type theory that make HoTT into a computable language. As a language for theorizing, however, topos theory sounds far more promising, as we will see next.</p>
<h3 id="topos-theoretic-social-science">Topos-theoretic Social Science</h3>
<p>To give an idea of their mathematical expressiveness, a topos can be defined in 13 different ways, via different mathematical languages (2015: 41, fn. 2). For our purposes, the simplest is that a topos is a category with two additional conditions: it is â€˜Cartesian closedâ€™ and it has a subobject classifier (Bhattacharyya, 2012: 16). The first condition is easy to understand if youâ€™ve run into group theory: a cartesian closed category admits a basic algebra whereby objects have products and exponents.</p>
<p>For the second condition, a subobject classifier provides a category with a logic of wholes and parts. Viewed through the lens of social science, a subobject classifier is a structured way to provide graduated, indexed and/or spectral distinctions within a stable set of values, and lets agents assess how incremental differences affect spaces or structures of interest (2015: 41-2).</p>
<p>Unlike the humanities where â€˜toposâ€™ is an incredibly pretentious word for a theme or topic, a topos in math should be thought of as an extended notion of place (Zalamea, 2018: 255). Topos theory makes space a more primary concept than points, unlike set-theoretic approaches that must spell out space as an aggregate of points (Plotnitsky, 2012: 355). This opens the way for â€˜point-freeâ€™ topology, with objects defined only through flux processes (Zalamea, 2018: 255). In short, topoi allow an â€œ<em>algebraic</em> concept of space, which applies to conventional spatial objects but extends beyond themâ€ (Plotnitsky, 2012: 355).</p>
<p>The concept of sheaf becomes important here, where sheaves behave as â€œglobal comprehensionsâ€¦where all local informationâ€¦become glued togetherâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 261). In fact, a topos can be defined as a category of sheaves over an abstract topology (ibid., 254). The clearest definition of sheaf Iâ€™ve found is given by Plotnitsky (2012: 362-3):</p>
<blockquote>
A sheaf is a particular kind of arrow space, Y â‡’ X, over (projected onto) a given space, X, associating a space A, to each point of X, which is why it is called a â€˜sheafâ€™, a sheaf of spaces over a given space, which can, again, be a single point. By making each topos a whole <em>category</em> of sheaves and thus <em>spaces</em> (plural) over and indeed defining a given space, the concept topos â€˜multipliesâ€™ this concept into an immensely rich architecture, again, even if X is a single point.
</blockquote>
<p>More concisely, a sheaf is â€œjust two topological spaces related by a projection with a good local behaviourâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 253). These sheaves can be glued together or restricted to produce processes coupled across levels (Sallach, 2015: 42). Much like relativity theory, sheaves act like reference frames, where each sheaf in a topos has its own local logic (ibid., 44).</p>
<p>This is the sense in which Badiou draws upon topoi to express â€˜logics of worldsâ€™. A topos can encode a logic, such as fuzzy logic where truth values occur along the interval [0,1], or paraconsistent logic â€œwhere we can have local contradictions without forcing global contradictions, which would destroy the systemâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 254). Curiously, Badiou leans heavily on this logical interpretation of topoi, while adopting a more spatial perspective allows us to talk about a plurality of possible ontologies, rather than only a plurality of logics (Plotnitsky, 2018: 361). Rather than a universe of sets, we can move to a multiverse of topoi, each with its own dialectic of wholes and parts (Bhattacharyya, 2012: 17).</p>
<p>In this light, Sallach (2015: 46-7) raises a compelling example of the kind of new insights that topos theory can bring to social science. Since a topos allows local definition of truth, each social actor can have their own private method of attributing truth, which can differ by power relations, ingroup/ outgroup status, or hierarchical scale. Hence, topos theory should make it possible to simulate the aggregate effects of diverse truth-attribution practices among agents. Adding more quantitative machinery, it should even be possible to study statistical distributions of truth-attribution.</p>
<p>All this sounds promising as a way to formalize social theories that are currently only expressed in a qualitative way. The baby examples that Sallach provides arenâ€™t quite enough to sway a skeptic, but I hope to have shown that the overall idea is sound. Topos theory opens up new questions of elasticity versus rigidity of social transformations, or continuity versus separation of societal fields, and offers â€œa dynamical study of dynamicsâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 254) with the immense power of abstraction that social theory needs.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Sallach has been radio-silent since about 2016 â€” which could mean heâ€™s working on a treatise that will revolutionize social science, or that heâ€™s retired. Iâ€™m always excited to hear about new types of math being applied in social science, and am confident that such a powerful formalism can generate radical new ideas. It just hasnâ€™t yet. While Iâ€™m not in a position to give substantive criticism, Sallachâ€™s project clearly suffers a lot from a lack of collaboration with mathematicians, as well as his desire to reconstruct social theory from scratch rather than work with whatâ€™s already there.</p>
<p>While topos-theoretic social science still lacks any killer applications, it could just be that the idea is too far ahead of its time. A recent book by Schultz &amp; Spivak (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10258">2019</a>) uses topos theory to develop a â€˜temporal type theoryâ€™ that can analyze and compare systems with both continuous dynamics (e.g. differential equations) or discrete dynamics (e.g. jumps). One highly practical application has been to construct a provably correct air traffic control system, and I hope there is much more to come.</p>

<p>David Sallach is a mathematical sociologist at Argonne National Laboratory, and senior fellow at the University of Chicagoâ€™s Computation Institute. Over the past decade he has researched category theory as a foundation for computational social science, with topos theory as his main framework.</p>
<p>In philosophy circles, topos theory is best known as the machinery behind Badiouâ€™s <em>Logics of Worlds</em>. It is often brought up by Zalamea, who outlines how the closely-related sheaf theory opens up novel relations between local and global that philosophy should take up in turn. Yet, due to the obvious barriers to entry, most attempts at this have just been exercises in hand-waving.</p>
<p>This post aims to give a general overview of Sallachâ€™s research project, from the preliminary concepts it started with, onward to the process of narrowing down among competing frameworks, and finally to the new ideas that topos theory can bring for social analysis. I assure you, I am in no position to talk about these things, but no-one else is going to do it, so what the heck.</p>
<h3 id="categorical-sociology">Categorical Sociology</h3>
<p>Sallach comes from a background in computational social science, which at this point is essentially a hodgepodge of agent-based simulations and social network modelling. While itâ€™s possible to make highly practical models, lack of underlying theory makes it very hard to draw general conclusions.</p>
<p>An obvious reason why category theory suggests itself is its potential to tie together many disparate formalisms currently in use. Culture is a network of networks, where social distinctions create ingroups and outgroups, with an associated core and periphery (2011: 7). The main unit here is discrete agents, but itâ€™s also natural to think of macro-level trends as if they were continuous.</p>
<p>Curiously, a major part of Sallachâ€™s initial metaphors come from topological quantum field theory. Rather than quantitative metrics, here we are interested in topology change, a far more â€˜qualitativeâ€™ kind of reasoning, much like how we think of transforming social structures. We want to analyze degrees of freedom as capacities for variation, and how changes propagate through them (2011: 10).</p>
<p>Similarly, it seldom makes sense to say that two social tendencies are â€˜equalâ€™ in a mathematical way, and a major benefit of categories is to allow weaker forms of equality. Objects in a category are specified only â€˜up to isomorphismâ€™, where instead of spelling out how two things are the same, they are simply taken as indistinguishable. Further, if two things are equivalent up to isomorphism, these equivalences can likewise be equivalent from the point of view of a higher category, in a â€œrecursive weakening of the notion of uniquenessâ€ (Baez &amp; Dolan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9802029.pdf">1998</a>), allowing various levels of granularity.</p>
<p>However, categorical objects tend to be viewed as invariants, of which there are few in the social world â€” death and taxes excepted. To get around this problem, for Sallach the main objects of categorical social theory are ideal types, never appearing in pure form empirically (2012a: 12).</p>
<p>Sallach extends this notion of ideal type by drawing from Karl Popperâ€™s propensity interpretation of probability. The paradigmatic example here is rolling a die: we know the odds of getting a given side are 1 in 6, but frequentist probability must justify this through a complex rigmarole of supposing an infinite sequence of dice rolls that would solidify these probabilities. Itâ€™s far more cogent to say these probabilities are built into the structure of the die (6 equal sides, etc.). Thus: â€œPropensity measures the causal pressure exerted by certain conditions toward the realization of certain eventsâ€ (2011: 11).</p>
<p>Especially in contexts like quantum theory, we want to talk about the chances of an atom decaying, even though it will decay only once â€” i.e. single-case statistics. Analogously, we also want to be talk about probability in the case of broad social tendencies whose conditions can never be replicated again. Hence, Urbach (1980) extends the notion of propensity in a direction that Popper himself would have hated, to encompass the holistic forces dealt with in sociology. His key example is Durkheimâ€™s study of suicide, which found a remarkable persistence in suicide rates irrespective of mortality rates, with equally-persisting discontinuities across state and demographic boundaries.</p>
<p>Because â€˜propensityâ€™ is such an underdetermined concept, it applies to vastly different social fields and forces, making it ideal for the level of abstraction in category theory (2012b: 7-8); in fact, a metaphorical inspiration here is quantum spin networks (2011: 11). The next step is to find morphisms <em>g</em>: A â‡’ B, i.e. processes carrying a system from state A to state B (2011: 10). The wealth of categorical abstractions lets us express dynamics subject to local entanglements, as actorsâ€™ endogenous behaviour gives rise to emergent structure.</p>
<p>In sum, the appeal of category theory in social science is to bridge continuous and discrete patterns, and allow â€˜calibrated generalizationâ€™ of social transformations rather than strict equality (2012b: 2). Most of all it offers a form of recursive locality, giving a unified way to analyze bottom-up emergent effects of aggregated agents, plus top-down structural effects on micro-level decisions (2012b: 6).</p>
<h3 id="social-homotopy-types">Social Homotopy Types</h3>
<p>In 2013, some of the greatest mathematicians in the world published a new foundations of mathematics: homotopy type theory. Naturally, this is exciting stuff, which led Sallach into a detour to see how HoTT might bear upon social science. I feel like not much actually came out of this project, but itâ€™s still worth seeing how he went about it.</p>
<p>Type theory originated in response to a paradox in the foundations of mathematics. Russellâ€™s paradox runs: if a barber shaves everyone who doesnâ€™t shave himself, who shaves the barber? If he does, he doesnâ€™t; if he doesnâ€™t he does. The paradox extends to set theory, at that time the main building block for all mathematics. Russell &amp; Whiteheadâ€™s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> used type theory to circumvent it. Imagine a village with a system of castes <strong>1</strong>,<strong>2</strong>,<strong>3</strong>,<strong>4</strong>, where <strong>4</strong> is higher than <strong>3</strong>, <strong>3</strong> than <strong>2</strong>, <strong>2</strong> than <strong>1</strong>. A person may only be shaved by someone of a lower caste (e.g. a <strong>3</strong> by a <strong>2</strong> or <strong>1</strong>). Since there is no self-shaving, there is no paradox (Doxiadis &amp; Papadimitriou, 2009: 174-5).</p>
<p>In this sense, type theory refutes the claim that â€œeverything is a setâ€ (de Bruijn, 1995: 28). However, until quite recently it was unclear just how the two differ. One property peculiar to types is that â€œany definable property of objects is invariantâ€ (Awodey, 2014: 7). The solution, it turns out, is to view types as <em>spaces</em>, and examine them with a branch of math that concentrates on spaces: topology.</p>
<p>Topology is the mathematics of squishing shapes into other shapes. A well-known result is that, squish as you might, a sphere canâ€™t be made into a doughnut without tearing it. That is, there exist invariants to the squishability of shapes. If a shape is only a squish or two away from another shape â€” that is, there exists a <em>homotopy</em> between the two â€” the shapes are â€˜homotopy equivalentâ€™.</p>
<p>To put this more formally, if <strong>T</strong> is a topological space, then two elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <strong>T</strong> are identical if <strong>T</strong> has a continuous path from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em> (Leslie-Hurd &amp; Haworth, 2013: 101). Given functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> mapping <strong>T</strong> onto another space <strong>U</strong>, a homotopy morphs one map into another. This means that a homotopy can â€œcleanly lift the notion of identity from elements <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to functions <em>f</em> and <em>g</em>â€ (ibid.).</p>
<p>HoTT closely corresponds to <em>n</em>-category theory, which uses layers of categories to leverage weak equivalences, thereby incorporating greater complexity (2012a: 14). The appeal of HoTT for social science is the high expressiveness afforded by its higher-order logic, which allows (2014: 2):</p>
<ol>
<li>an ability to customize equivalences,</li>
<li>a means of demarcating discourse boundaries, and</li>
<li>creation of specialized spaces and shapes to which social processes can be mapped.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the notion of isomorphism lets us ignore all the quantitative details of social transfomation, HoTT can talk about this topologically. Identity in HoTT means two objects are the same homotopy type, so their transformations through deformation will be isomorphic; social interaction can thereby be seen as progession along one such path (2014: 6). It also lets us attribute agency to these transformations by means of type constructors: â€œa social actor can be an elicitor, a role in which one seeks to alter the motive pattern of another, and thus change the otherâ€™s social typeâ€ (2014: 8).</p>
<p>One last interesting detail about HoTT is that it can be used as a proof language to formally verify theorems. Thus it lends itself to axiomatic approaches to social science, such as that attempted in Austrian economics. Given social scientistsâ€™ well-known inability to agree on even the simplest of terms, the odds seem stacked against such a project. Still, perhaps such a highly abstract language can identify common ground among seemingly incommensurate approaches, such as the following otherworldly axioms (2016a: 8):</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Axiom 4a</strong>. The more directly that the path of a social actor or cultural trend approaches an idealized conceptual pole, the higher is the n-category required to characterize its structure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Axiom 5</strong>. The more rapidly a social actor or cultural trend approaches an idealized conceptual pole, the more morphisms it manifests.
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, Sallach prefers to use HoTT metaphorically, mapping from qualitative social concepts to mathematical ones. Yet, Iâ€™d be far more impressed if he approached it from a quantitative angle, showing how one well-known model in the social sciences topologically morphs into another. Still, given its Rosetta stone-like translation into categories, HoTT may prove to be a powerful tool for implementing categorical social science, by means of tools such as cubical type theory that make HoTT into a computable language. As a language for theorizing, however, topos theory sounds far more promising, as we will see next.</p>
<h3 id="topos-theoretic-social-science">Topos-theoretic Social Science</h3>
<p>To give an idea of their mathematical expressiveness, a topos can be defined in 13 different ways, via different mathematical languages (2015: 41, fn. 2). For our purposes, the simplest is that a topos is a category with two additional conditions: it is â€˜Cartesian closedâ€™ and it has a subobject classifier (Bhattacharyya, 2012: 16). The first condition is easy to understand if youâ€™ve run into group theory: a cartesian closed category admits a basic algebra whereby objects have products and exponents.</p>
<p>For the second condition, a subobject classifier provides a category with a logic of wholes and parts. Viewed through the lens of social science, a subobject classifier is a structured way to provide graduated, indexed and/or spectral distinctions within a stable set of values, and lets agents assess how incremental differences affect spaces or structures of interest (2015: 41-2).</p>
<p>Unlike the humanities where â€˜toposâ€™ is an incredibly pretentious word for a theme or topic, a topos in math should be thought of as an extended notion of place (Zalamea, 2018: 255). Topos theory makes space a more primary concept than points, unlike set-theoretic approaches that must spell out space as an aggregate of points (Plotnitsky, 2012: 355). This opens the way for â€˜point-freeâ€™ topology, with objects defined only through flux processes (Zalamea, 2018: 255). In short, topoi allow an â€œ<em>algebraic</em> concept of space, which applies to conventional spatial objects but extends beyond themâ€ (Plotnitsky, 2012: 355).</p>
<p>The concept of sheaf becomes important here, where sheaves behave as â€œglobal comprehensionsâ€¦where all local informationâ€¦become glued togetherâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 261). In fact, a topos can be defined as a category of sheaves over an abstract topology (ibid., 254). The clearest definition of sheaf Iâ€™ve found is given by Plotnitsky (2012: 362-3):</p>
<blockquote>
A sheaf is a particular kind of arrow space, Y â‡’ X, over (projected onto) a given space, X, associating a space A, to each point of X, which is why it is called a â€˜sheafâ€™, a sheaf of spaces over a given space, which can, again, be a single point. By making each topos a whole <em>category</em> of sheaves and thus <em>spaces</em> (plural) over and indeed defining a given space, the concept topos â€˜multipliesâ€™ this concept into an immensely rich architecture, again, even if X is a single point.
</blockquote>
<p>More concisely, a sheaf is â€œjust two topological spaces related by a projection with a good local behaviourâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 253). These sheaves can be glued together or restricted to produce processes coupled across levels (Sallach, 2015: 42). Much like relativity theory, sheaves act like reference frames, where each sheaf in a topos has its own local logic (ibid., 44).</p>
<p>This is the sense in which Badiou draws upon topoi to express â€˜logics of worldsâ€™. A topos can encode a logic, such as fuzzy logic where truth values occur along the interval [0,1], or paraconsistent logic â€œwhere we can have local contradictions without forcing global contradictions, which would destroy the systemâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 254). Curiously, Badiou leans heavily on this logical interpretation of topoi, while adopting a more spatial perspective allows us to talk about a plurality of possible ontologies, rather than only a plurality of logics (Plotnitsky, 2018: 361). Rather than a universe of sets, we can move to a multiverse of topoi, each with its own dialectic of wholes and parts (Bhattacharyya, 2012: 17).</p>
<p>In this light, Sallach (2015: 46-7) raises a compelling example of the kind of new insights that topos theory can bring to social science. Since a topos allows local definition of truth, each social actor can have their own private method of attributing truth, which can differ by power relations, ingroup/ outgroup status, or hierarchical scale. Hence, topos theory should make it possible to simulate the aggregate effects of diverse truth-attribution practices among agents. Adding more quantitative machinery, it should even be possible to study statistical distributions of truth-attribution.</p>
<p>All this sounds promising as a way to formalize social theories that are currently only expressed in a qualitative way. The baby examples that Sallach provides arenâ€™t quite enough to sway a skeptic, but I hope to have shown that the overall idea is sound. Topos theory opens up new questions of elasticity versus rigidity of social transformations, or continuity versus separation of societal fields, and offers â€œa dynamical study of dynamicsâ€ (Zalamea, 2018: 254) with the immense power of abstraction that social theory needs.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Sallach has been radio-silent since about 2016 â€” which could mean heâ€™s working on a treatise that will revolutionize social science, or that heâ€™s retired. Iâ€™m always excited to hear about new types of math being applied in social science, and am confident that such a powerful formalism can generate radical new ideas. It just hasnâ€™t yet. While Iâ€™m not in a position to give substantive criticism, Sallachâ€™s project clearly suffers a lot from a lack of collaboration with mathematicians, as well as his desire to reconstruct social theory from scratch rather than work with whatâ€™s already there.</p>
<p>While topos-theoretic social science still lacks any killer applications, it could just be that the idea is too far ahead of its time. A recent book by Schultz &amp; Spivak (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10258">2019</a>) uses topos theory to develop a â€˜temporal type theoryâ€™ that can analyze and compare systems with both continuous dynamics (e.g. differential equations) or discrete dynamics (e.g. jumps). One highly practical application has been to construct a provably correct air traffic control system, and I hope there is much more to come.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Itâ€™s a part of popular myth that the Qwerty keyboard was designed to keep old-fashioned keys from jamming, and was thus a deliberately worse design that became standard. Based on this metaphor, the object of qwernomics is â€œthe historical, technological, and economic process of â€˜lock-inâ€™ through positive feedbackâ€, studying â€˜qwerty-worldsâ€™ dominated by suboptimal local maxima (Land, <a href="https://thenewcentre.org/archive/qwernomics-path-dependency-semiotic-fatality">2016</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, itâ€™s deeply controversial whether this account of Qwerty is true, but this controversy is itself a core part of qwernomics â€” whether it is possible, within a path-dependent regime, to identify global criteria (such as ergonomics) that let us objectively determine if we are in a suboptimal state.</p>
<p>What if Qwerty isnâ€™t the exception, but the rule? David (1985: 336) points to various other examples in economic history, and the metaphor ties in nicely with economic accounts of market failure, as well as extending to subject matter such as vestigial structures in evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Nick Landâ€™s more recent thoughts try to take the idea even further by reading the keyboard through <a href="https://equivalentexchange.blog/2010/11/29/hjelmslevs-net/">Hjelmslev</a>â€™s quadripartite semiotics, as a paradigmatic example that can take Deleuze &amp; Guattariâ€™s stratoanalysis from pure theory into a workable discipline. This search for nuance often amounts to a paranoiac cryptoanalysis of the keyboardâ€™s geography, culminating in the â€˜extreme qwernomic thesisâ€™ that a future alien civilization could reconstruct all human knowledge from Qwerty alone.</p>
<p>My own interest in qwernomics stems from the idea of computationally simulating a sign-system (cf. <a href="https://gjoncas.github.io/posts/2019-12-08-tulpalgorithms.html">egregorics</a>). In this view, qwernomics gives a self-contained semiosis we can understand in detail. Below Iâ€™ll elaborate on this using a program to translate from Qwerty to Dvorak, revealing overlaps and invariances. Then we can examine this translation process itself through iteration, to locate even further structure. Last, Iâ€™ll explore qwernomics more deeply, and suggest further avenues to explore.</p>
<h3 id="semiotic-fixpoints">Semiotic Fixpoints</h3>
<p>A qwernomic puzzle by <a href="https://twitter.com/cyborg_nomade/status/1157262388879601664">@cyborg_nomade</a>: suppose we transpose the alphabet onto the Qwerty keyboard in order: â€˜qâ€™=â€˜aâ€™, â€˜wâ€™=â€˜bâ€™, and so on; which keystrokes will yield English words on both the Qwerty and alphabetic keyboard? More interesting: are any words the same on both keyboards?</p>
<p>The latter is actually quite easy to answer â€” all we have to do is write the letters in a list. Letâ€™s also throw in the Dvorak keyboard to make things interesting.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1">alpha  <span class="fu">=</span> [<span class="ch">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="fu">..</span><span class="ch">&#39;z&#39;</span>]</a>

<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" data-line-number="3">          <span class="ch">&#39;a&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;s&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;d&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;f&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;g&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;h&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;j&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;k&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;l&#39;</span>,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" data-line-number="4">          <span class="ch">&#39;z&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;x&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;c&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;v&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;b&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;n&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;m&#39;</span>]</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" data-line-number="5">dvorak <span class="fu">=</span> [<span class="ch">&#39;p&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;y&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;f&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;g&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;c&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;r&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;l&#39;</span>,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" data-line-number="6">          <span class="ch">&#39;a&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;o&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;e&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;u&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;i&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;d&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;h&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;t&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;n&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;s&#39;</span>,</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" data-line-number="7">          <span class="ch">&#39;q&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;j&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;k&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;x&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;b&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;m&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;w&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;v&#39;</span>,<span class="ch">&#39;z&#39;</span>]</a></code></pre></div>
<p>If we put all the keys in a single line, we can see just by eyeballing that in Qwerty and Dvorak, the â€˜xâ€™, â€˜oâ€™, and â€˜dâ€™ keys are in the same position. Thus, words such as â€˜doâ€™, â€˜oxâ€™, â€˜oddâ€™, â€˜dodoâ€™ and â€˜doxxâ€™ are all <em>fixpoints</em>, taking the <em>n</em>th keys in both systems. (Note that these arenâ€™t the same physical keys.)</p>
<p>We can confirm this by writing a Haskell function to do exactly what we would do in eyeballing, only more thoroughly. Reading from right to left, it takes two lists (e.g. <code>xs</code>=alpha and <code>ys</code>=qwerty), then <code>zip</code> puts them in pairs, like <code>('a','q')</code>. We want to know that the two elements are equal, which is what the lambda function does (<code>\(x,y) -&gt; x==y</code>). Last, <code>filter</code> gives us only the pairs that satisfy that equality, and <code>map fst</code> gives us the first element of each such pair.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">fixpoints xs ys <span class="fu">=</span> map fst <span class="fu">$</span> filter (\(x,y) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> x<span class="fu">==</span>y) <span class="fu">$</span> zip xs ys</a></code></pre></div>
<p>From this we find that the alphabetic and Dvorak keyboard only have â€˜zâ€™ in the same place. Last, <code>alpha</code> and <code>qwerty</code> have no pairs: no words are the same on both keyboards. We can visualize these correspondences as follows, going clockwise from 90Â°.</p>

<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/keyboard-ring.png" />
</center>
<p>For finding â€˜revolving pairsâ€™ between alphabetic and Qwerty, <a href="https://twitter.com/eccehetero/status/1157640471335899138">@eccehetero</a> has already done this in Java (<a href="https://pastebin.com/GZGtydeY">code</a>; <a href="https://pastebin.com/aY9pA8Ya">results</a>). Notably, he points out its similarity to cryptography, such as the Caesar cipher. Since alpha-to-Qwerty translation is taken care of, here Iâ€™d like to experiment with Qwerty-to-Dvorak.</p>
<p>To compare whole words, weâ€™ll need a function to convert from one keyboard to another. Note that this requires functions from the Data.List and Data.Maybe libraries.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">convert xs ys []     <span class="fu">=</span> []</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">convert xs ys (z<span class="fu">:</span>zs) <span class="fu">=</span> (toEnum (fromEnum z <span class="fu">+</span> shift)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Char</span>) <span class="fu">:</span> convert xs ys zs</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3">                        <span class="kw">where</span> kNums <span class="fu">=</span> zipWith (<span class="fu">-</span>) (map fromEnum ys) (map fromEnum xs)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4">                              shift <span class="fu">=</span> kNums <span class="fu">!!</span> fromJust (elemIndex z xs)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Our function <code>convert</code> takes two lists â€” the one weâ€™re starting from (<code>xs</code>), and the one we want to convert it to (<code>ys</code>). It also takes a string <code>(z:zs)</code>, where <code>z</code> is the head or first letter of that string. The core idea is just to convert letters to numbers (<code>fromEnum</code>), add a â€˜shiftâ€™ factor, and then convert back to letters (<code>toEnum</code>). We get this shift factor by pairing up letters, converting them to numbers, and subtracting. Then for a given letter <code>z</code> (the <em>n</em>th on the keyboard) we just find the corresponding shift.</p>
<p>To translate key-wise from Qwerty to Dvorak, we can just use <code>map (convert qwerty dvorak) words</code>, where <code>words</code> is a list of strings. One list of 58K words is available <a href="http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, however, <code>convert</code> isnâ€™t super-efficient, since weâ€™re reconstructing this list of shift factors over and over again for each letter. To go through an entire dictionary, itâ€™s better to define this list separately and take it as an argument to the function. This is actually really easy, but less general:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">qwertyToDvorak <span class="fu">=</span> zipWith (<span class="fu">-</span>) (map fromEnum dvorak) (map fromEnum qwerty)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" data-line-number="3">convert&#39; xs shifts []     <span class="fu">=</span> []</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" data-line-number="4">convert&#39; xs shifts (z<span class="fu">:</span>zs) <span class="fu">=</span> (toEnum (fromEnum z <span class="fu">+</span> shift)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Char</span>) <span class="fu">:</span> convert&#39; xs shifts zs</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" data-line-number="5">                                     <span class="kw">where</span> shift <span class="fu">=</span> shifts <span class="fu">!!</span> fromJust (elemIndex z xs)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>With this done, the crucial function to use is the following, which converts the words and then filters out those that arenâ€™t in the dictionary.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">filter (\word <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> word <span class="ot">`elem`</span> dictionary) <span class="fu">$</span> map (convert&#39; qwerty qwertyToDvorak) dictionary</a></code></pre></div>
<p>After back-translating the result to Qwerty, we get this list of words, in the format <code>(qwerty,dvorak)</code>:</p>
<p><code>[(&quot;bid&quot;,&quot;wad&quot;),(&quot;bids&quot;,&quot;wadi&quot;),(&quot;bob&quot;,&quot;wow&quot;),(&quot;boo&quot;,&quot;woo&quot;),(&quot;bop&quot;,&quot;woe&quot;),(&quot;cad&quot;,&quot;bud&quot;),(&quot;car&quot;,&quot;bug&quot;),(&quot;caw&quot;,&quot;buy&quot;),(&quot;cob&quot;,&quot;bow&quot;),(&quot;coo&quot;,&quot;boo&quot;),(&quot;copy&quot;,&quot;boer&quot;),(&quot;cor&quot;,&quot;bog&quot;),(&quot;coup&quot;,&quot;bole&quot;),(&quot;cow&quot;,&quot;boy&quot;),(&quot;cox&quot;,&quot;box&quot;),(&quot;dad&quot;,&quot;dud&quot;),(&quot;did&quot;,&quot;dad&quot;),(&quot;do&quot;,&quot;do&quot;),(&quot;dodo&quot;,&quot;dodo&quot;),(&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dot&quot;),(&quot;doh&quot;,&quot;don&quot;),(&quot;dopy&quot;,&quot;doer&quot;),(&quot;dor&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;),(&quot;dot&quot;,&quot;doc&quot;),(&quot;ear&quot;,&quot;fug&quot;),(&quot;fag&quot;,&quot;hut&quot;),(&quot;far&quot;,&quot;hug&quot;),(&quot;fig&quot;,&quot;hat&quot;),(&quot;fir&quot;,&quot;hag&quot;),(&quot;fob&quot;,&quot;how&quot;),(&quot;fog&quot;,&quot;hot&quot;),(&quot;food&quot;,&quot;hood&quot;),(&quot;fop&quot;,&quot;hoe&quot;),(&quot;for&quot;,&quot;hog&quot;),(&quot;gaga&quot;,&quot;tutu&quot;),(&quot;gig&quot;,&quot;tat&quot;),(&quot;go&quot;,&quot;to&quot;),(&quot;goo&quot;,&quot;too&quot;),(&quot;ha&quot;,&quot;nu&quot;),(&quot;hag&quot;,&quot;nut&quot;),(&quot;hic&quot;,&quot;nab&quot;),(&quot;ho&quot;,&quot;no&quot;),(&quot;hob&quot;,&quot;now&quot;),(&quot;hod&quot;,&quot;nod&quot;),(&quot;hog&quot;,&quot;not&quot;),(&quot;if&quot;,&quot;ah&quot;),(&quot;irish&quot;,&quot;again&quot;),(&quot;jap&quot;,&quot;sue&quot;),(&quot;job&quot;,&quot;sow&quot;),(&quot;jog&quot;,&quot;sot&quot;),(&quot;lag&quot;,&quot;jut&quot;),(&quot;log&quot;,&quot;jot&quot;),(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;joy&quot;),(&quot;moo&quot;,&quot;zoo&quot;),(&quot;odd&quot;,&quot;odd&quot;),(&quot;of&quot;,&quot;oh&quot;),(&quot;oh&quot;,&quot;on&quot;),(&quot;ox&quot;,&quot;ox&quot;),(&quot;pig&quot;,&quot;eat&quot;),(&quot;pro&quot;,&quot;ego&quot;),(&quot;rag&quot;,&quot;gut&quot;),(&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;guy&quot;),(&quot;rid&quot;,&quot;gad&quot;),(&quot;rocs&quot;,&quot;gobi&quot;),(&quot;rod&quot;,&quot;god&quot;),(&quot;roo&quot;,&quot;goo&quot;),(&quot;soh&quot;,&quot;ion&quot;),(&quot;tag&quot;,&quot;cut&quot;),(&quot;tap&quot;,&quot;cue&quot;),(&quot;tic&quot;,&quot;cab&quot;),(&quot;tog&quot;,&quot;cot&quot;),(&quot;too&quot;,&quot;coo&quot;),(&quot;tow&quot;,&quot;coy&quot;),(&quot;toy&quot;,&quot;cor&quot;),(&quot;yap&quot;,&quot;rue&quot;),(&quot;yogi&quot;,&quot;rota&quot;)]</code></p>
<p>This gives 76 words out of 58,110, or 0.13%. Note the prevalence of words featuring â€˜oâ€™ and â€˜dâ€™, our semiotic fixpoints from before. Thereâ€™s nothing too eldritch, Iâ€™m afraid â€” the longest is irish/again. If anyone feels brave, thereâ€™s also a dictionary of 466K words <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words">here</a>, to root out more obscure pairings.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve put my code in a <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Qwernomics">GitHub repository</a>, which includes both 58K-word and 466K-word dictionaries, which can be imported as a module. The code could be improved in a lot of ways â€” notably, it breaks if it encounters a non-alphabetic character, like an apostrophe. Iâ€™d like to come back to it once Iâ€™ve learned more about data structures and parallelism, to see if my poor laptop can handle 466K words. The repo also has Ti<em>k</em>Z code for the diagrams in this post, which may be fun to experiment with. The arcs below are inspired by a much prettier version by <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/qwernomics">Amy Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="forbidden-keyboards">Forbidden Keyboards</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://twitter.com/8051Enthusiast/status/1279802890618626049">@8051Enthusiast</a> pointed out that changing from Qwerty to Dvorak is a permutation operation that can be repeated to give a DvorakÂ² â€” far more powerful than mere DvorakÂ¹.</p>
<p>All we need for this is to iterate our <code>convert</code> function from before. In <code>convert qwerty dvorak qwerty</code>, the first two arguments create a permutation from the Qwerty keyboard to a Dvorak keyboard, while the third argument (<code>qwerty</code> again) uses the whole Qwerty keyboard as material. Thus, to get Dvorak-squared, we can just do <code>convert qwerty dvorak (convert qwerty dvorak qwerty)</code>.</p>
<p>This gives the keys <code>&quot;erhtbgjuofladncvipsqxwzymk&quot;</code>, and the following diagram shows clearly that these permutations are the same.</p>
<center>
<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/qwerty-dvorak-dvorak2-big.png" />
</center>
<p>We can write this in a more sophisticated way using the <code>iterate</code> function, which repeats the <code>convert</code> operation as many times as we want.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">forbiddenDvorak n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="fu">|</span> (n<span class="fu">&lt;=</span><span class="dv">0</span>)    <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert dvorak qwerty) dvorak <span class="fu">!!</span> (abs n <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert qwerty dvorak) dvorak <span class="fu">!!</span> (n<span class="fu">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Thus we can get Dvorak-cubed, up to any power <code>n</code> that we want. Notice that Iâ€™ve included the case where <code>n</code> is less than zero. This acts as an inverse function, or the reverse permutation (here from Dvorak back to Qwerty).</p>
<center>
<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/dvorak-inverse.png" />
</center>
<p>Perhaps the most curious aspect is that if we keep iterating our function, weâ€™ll eventually get back to where we started. We can check this by creating a list of Dvorak<sup>n</sup> keyboards for increasingly higher powers, and seeing if any besides the first are the same as Dvorak. (The <code>fmap (+2)</code> is because indexing starts at zero, plus weâ€™re excluding DvorakÂ¹ = Dvorak.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">fmap (<span class="fu">+</span><span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="fu">$</span> elemIndex dvorak <span class="fu">$</span> map forbiddenDvorak [<span class="dv">2</span><span class="fu">..</span><span class="dv">250</span>]</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This outputs <code>Just 211</code>, and as we can plug in and confirm, <code>forbiddenDvorak 211</code> gives the Dvorak keyboard. You can likewise confirm that <code>forbiddenDvorak 210</code> gives Qwerty, which of course follows.</p>
<p>We can make an analogous function permuting alphabetical order into Qwerty:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1">forbiddenQwerty n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="fu">|</span> (n<span class="fu">&lt;=</span><span class="dv">0</span>)    <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert qwerty alpha) qwerty <span class="fu">!!</span> (abs n <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert alpha qwerty) qwerty <span class="fu">!!</span> (n<span class="fu">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>This one cycles after only 42 iterations. If the obvious association just came to mind, thatâ€™s a taste of the mix between wild coincidence and transcendental conspiracy that defines CCRU humour.</p>
<p>As an exercise, make a <code>forbiddenAlpha</code> function that converts from alphabetic to Dvorak. This one also has a cycle â€” itâ€™s quite a bit larger than 250, but itâ€™s there, and you can find it on your laptop.</p>
<p>I know very little about abstract algebra, but this opens up numerous interesting questions. I didnâ€™t include punctuation for each keyboard layout, but how would these cycles change if we added it? Why does <code>forbiddenQwerty</code> cycle so much sooner than the others, and is there a metric to measure how â€˜closeâ€™ a permutation is? Last, I canâ€™t help but wonder if this group-theoretic structure is an artifact of our simple example, or whether it can be found in more complex sign-systems.</p>

<h3 id="qwerno-materialism">Qwerno-materialism</h3>
<p>For Le (2019: 100-1), qwernomics represents how â€œthe demands of capital accumulation led the technology of the keyboard to develop down a de-anthropomorphising path from which we could not diverge.â€ That is, assuming Qwertyâ€™s inferiority, companiesâ€™ myopic refusal to train their workers in a better typographic system is â€œexemplary of technocapitalismâ€™s way of locking us into a trajectory that will ultimately dehumanise us.â€ (Though dehumanization isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing!) While this may be a fair reading of Landâ€™s original essay, in light of his 2016 lectures itâ€™s far too glib.</p>
<p>Consider Nash equilibrium, where no agent can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. It may be, as in the Prisonerâ€™s dilemma, that if all players changed their strategy, all could benefit, but none can on their own. Conversely, qwernomics presents a situation where any one player can unilaterally benefit from changing their strategy (e.g. a firm switching from Qwerty to Dvorak), but the societal transaction costs are so large that â€” across different games â€” they nullify this advantage.</p>
<p>This parallels the notion of patchwork, where normally a larger country is more efficient due to economies of scale, but now the transaction costs associated with large political institutions are so immense as to outweigh all these benefits, so on net itâ€™s more efficient just to have a smaller state.</p>
<p>Choosing a keyboard is a non-ergodic process, in that we cannot freely wander through the space of possibilities toward a global optimum, where Qwerty has come out best from untrammeled market experimentation. An ergodic process tends toward a fixpoint or equilibrium, while non-ergodic systems do not, but exhibit path dependency, where states far in the past can influence states far into the future. Land perceptively notes that this division of ergodic versus non-ergodic is similar to molar (tending toward an average) versus molecular (centrifugally tending away from an average).</p>
<p>If Qwerty represents a â€˜market solutionâ€™, Dvorak represents â€˜rational planningâ€™ from top-down. Yet, we can also imagine a centrally-planned society unwilling to escape from Qwerty lock-in, where the benefits of Dvorak are judged as not worth the cost of retraining and retooling. Thus, qwernomics is not limited to this simple opposition of interventionism versus spontaneity. In either system, transaction costs have built up over time, so that Qwerty becomes a self-installing law.</p>
<p>Just as Keynesian economics claims that markets get stuck in a low-employment equilibrium, which we can identify from a superior frame, we want to know by what criteria we could evaluate our path as suboptimal from a rational, Archimedean point. Ergonomics seems like the best candidate for Qwerty, but is that all a keyboard really is? The deeper notion here is that a Schelling point â€” an arbitrary but handy standard, like driving on the right side of the road â€” creates the possibility space by which we can retroactively judge it. At a certain point, the standard consumes the horizon.</p>
<p>As another example, Land explicitly compares Qwertyâ€™s hegemony to that of decimal numeracy, and some mathematicians claim octal numbers are superior. Conversely, vestigial tails are evocative, but key to qwernomics is plasticity of agentsâ€™ behaviour: theyâ€™re free to use a different keyboard if they want to, but donâ€™t â€” rather than having a suboptimal state biologically baked into them.</p>
<p>Thus, the main flaw in Leâ€™s account is workersâ€™ lack of agency. Moreover, instead of emphasizing suboptimality as â€˜dehumanizingâ€™, Landâ€™s main interest is in Qwerty as a causal loop, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop">bootstrap paradox</a> in time travel. Qwerty as a code represents a radically alien form of immanence: it is authoritative because it has made itself occur.</p>

<h3 id="stratoanalysis">Stratoanalysis</h3>
<p>Land goes on to use the Qwerty keyboard as a hermeneutic device to understand Deleuze &amp; Guattariâ€™s â€œGeology of Moralsâ€. There, stratoanalysis is introduced as a synonym for D&amp;Gâ€™s project, alongside rhizomatics, nomadology, schizoanalysis, pragmatics, and so on. In general, stratoanalysis is very seldom invoked, but itâ€™s actually quite rich as a framework.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the world is made up of relatively autonomous codes, such as the genetic code versus body language. The system of oppositions that defines a code takes place on an independent layer or stratum. Strata interact horizontally via <em>parastrata</em> (codes presupposed by another code of the same order, such as the prison system and legal system) â€” or vertically via <em>epistrata</em> (codes presupposed by another code of a different order, such as the legal system relying on language, biochemistry, and so on). An example of parastrata in Qwerty is using keys in a game for movement.</p>
<p>A keyboard lends itself as a paradigmatic example because it combines so many forms of code, at so many levels. There are linguistic codes (letters in English words), physical codes (limitations of human hands), and mechanical codes (technical specifications). Further, a keyboard embodies various semiotic distinctions, such as code vs. territory or form vs. substance. Qwerty takes the alphabet out of its â€˜territoryâ€™, as ordered in the ABCs song; likewise, the fingers of the typist are deterritorialized onto the keyboard. In this sense, Qwerty is an abstract diagram of stratification.</p>
<p>While typical semiotics deals with signifiers and signifieds, Deleuze &amp; Guattari draw from Hjelmslevâ€™s quadripartition. In a verbal language, expression-substance is the continuum of sounds producible by the human vocal apparatus; expression-form is its differentiation into phonemes (signifiers); content-substance is sphere of concepts; and content-form is its differentiation into signifieds [<a href="http://enl.auth.gr/gramma/gramma12/B.2.pdf">via</a>].</p>
<p>Analogously, if substance is the physical aspect, then a physical keyboard is content-substance, while Qwerty is an expression-substance. Likewise, the expression-form is the signifier being typed, while content-form is the signified. (Donâ€™t quote me on this, Iâ€™m sure I mangled it.) The main point is that variations such as Azerty keyboards for Francophones can be localized onto one of these planes.</p>
<p>Therefore, more broadly, qwernomics is an analysis of stratification or capture, as Qwerty directs codesâ€™ flows of intensities. Audaciously, we can say that qwerty is a cultural genome, with knowledge geologically deposited into it. By way of a quasi-diagrammatic analysis of the keyboard through stratograms, we can hack the cryptographic protocol that the qwerty apocalypse has delivered to us.</p>

<h3 id="the-extreme-qwernomic-thesis">The Extreme Qwernomic Thesis</h3>
<p>If all this sounds increasingly weird, then good. It gets weirder.</p>
<p>Above I stressed qwernomicsâ€™ skepticism towards global criteria for optimality, and we can radicalize this still further. One form has shown up in empirical studies: that even prior to Qwerty there was already a pool of typing competence that settled the arrangement of Qwerty. Hence, Qwerty has no localizable origin, and the entire geopolitical structure of world history is Qwerty-shaped.</p>
<p>Thus the â€˜extreme qwernomic thesisâ€™ can perhaps be most cogently stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
the highly obscure historical stratodynamic process from which we have inherited the keyboard is the same process that has provided us with all the cognitive resources that we could conceivably gain access [to] in investigating our object&quot; [2016, VII, around 41:00]
</blockquote>
<p>We can restate this in various other ways. (Iâ€™m mostly just plagiarizing Land here.)</p>
<p>The core idea is that of an immanent cognitive horizon: if qwerty is the machine talking about itself, there is no meta-discourse on the machine that weâ€™re ever going to find. There is no position of purchase or overview or superior perspective, because the function of overviewing is itself a product of a stratic mechanism, a symptom of stratic embeddedness. Hence there is no <em>possible</em> that isnâ€™t already within the processing system. The overview position itself is structured inside that strata.</p>
<p>Qwerty is the revelation of a transcendental cognitive engine, in that the cognitive machinery we are trying to put into play has to come out of our object. Faced with the immanence of all criteria, there is no way out, but only through â€” mining parts of the keyboard for parts of our theory, in the form of â€œdelirialized, wild particles of conceptionâ€ such as the <code>Ctrl</code> key as zone of transference between dimensional systems, or Qabbalistic resonances of the <code>Esc</code> key. The purpose of these schizoid parts of qwernomics is to explore the extent to which qwerty is a transcendental cognitive resource.</p>
<center>
<img src="/static/img/blog-posts/qwernomic-territory.png" />
</center>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Most of these statements sound absurd when applied to the keyboard, but the same considerations come into play for concrete problems where we donâ€™t have nearly as much of a conceptual foothold.</p>
<p>The ultimate stakes of qwernomics are to delineate the meaning of a â€˜critiqueâ€™ of capitalism, in the Kantian sense of a global tribunal of reason. Many people will be sympathetic to the notion that there is no such universal position; yet, even by calling something a local optimum at all, weâ€™re already implying the existence of some position of transcendent criticism. At a bare minimum, qwernomics makes us aware of the â€˜spectre of the universalâ€™ by which we criticize standards.</p>
<p>While I still havenâ€™t digested all this, it seems that simulation offers an interesting counterpoint. Instead of looking at our path from some external position and saying it was wrong, simulations immanently generate a multiplicity of paths to which we can compare our own. We donâ€™t need an Archimedean point, but only to differentiate the various strata as manifested in parameters that can undergo variations. Instead of a global perspective, we generate a garden of forking paths to populate the search space with purely local theories. This seems entirely compatible with the points made above. In a word, we can radicalize qwernomics still further into computational stratoanalysis.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a part of popular myth that the Qwerty keyboard was designed to keep old-fashioned keys from jamming, and was thus a deliberately worse design that became standard. Based on this metaphor, the object of qwernomics is â€œthe historical, technological, and economic process of â€˜lock-inâ€™ through positive feedbackâ€, studying â€˜qwerty-worldsâ€™ dominated by suboptimal local maxima (Land, <a href="https://thenewcentre.org/archive/qwernomics-path-dependency-semiotic-fatality">2016</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, itâ€™s deeply controversial whether this account of Qwerty is true, but this controversy is itself a core part of qwernomics â€” whether it is possible, within a path-dependent regime, to identify global criteria (such as ergonomics) that let us objectively determine if we are in a suboptimal state.</p>
<p>What if Qwerty isnâ€™t the exception, but the rule? David (1985: 336) points to various other examples in economic history, and the metaphor ties in nicely with economic accounts of market failure, as well as extending to subject matter such as vestigial structures in evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Nick Landâ€™s more recent thoughts try to take the idea even further by reading the keyboard through <a href="https://equivalentexchange.blog/2010/11/29/hjelmslevs-net/">Hjelmslev</a>â€™s quadripartite semiotics, as a paradigmatic example that can take Deleuze &amp; Guattariâ€™s stratoanalysis from pure theory into a workable discipline. This search for nuance often amounts to a paranoiac cryptoanalysis of the keyboardâ€™s geography, culminating in the â€˜extreme qwernomic thesisâ€™ that a future alien civilization could reconstruct all human knowledge from Qwerty alone.</p>
<p>My own interest in qwernomics stems from the idea of computationally simulating a sign-system (cf. <a href="https://gjoncas.github.io/posts/2019-12-08-tulpalgorithms.html">egregorics</a>). In this view, qwernomics gives a self-contained semiosis we can understand in detail. Below Iâ€™ll elaborate on this using a program to translate from Qwerty to Dvorak, revealing overlaps and invariances. Then we can examine this translation process itself through iteration, to locate even further structure. Last, Iâ€™ll explore qwernomics more deeply, and suggest further avenues to explore.</p>
<h3 id="semiotic-fixpoints">Semiotic Fixpoints</h3>
<p>A qwernomic puzzle by <a href="https://twitter.com/cyborg_nomade/status/1157262388879601664">@cyborg_nomade</a>: suppose we transpose the alphabet onto the Qwerty keyboard in order: â€˜qâ€™=â€˜aâ€™, â€˜wâ€™=â€˜bâ€™, and so on; which keystrokes will yield English words on both the Qwerty and alphabetic keyboard? More interesting: are any words the same on both keyboards?</p>
<p>The latter is actually quite easy to answer â€” all we have to do is write the letters in a list. Letâ€™s also throw in the Dvorak keyboard to make things interesting.</p>

<p>If we put all the keys in a single line, we can see just by eyeballing that in Qwerty and Dvorak, the â€˜xâ€™, â€˜oâ€™, and â€˜dâ€™ keys are in the same position. Thus, words such as â€˜doâ€™, â€˜oxâ€™, â€˜oddâ€™, â€˜dodoâ€™ and â€˜doxxâ€™ are all <em>fixpoints</em>, taking the <em>n</em>th keys in both systems. (Note that these arenâ€™t the same physical keys.)</p>
<p>We can confirm this by writing a Haskell function to do exactly what we would do in eyeballing, only more thoroughly. Reading from right to left, it takes two lists (e.g. <code>xs</code>=alpha and <code>ys</code>=qwerty), then <code>zip</code> puts them in pairs, like <code>('a','q')</code>. We want to know that the two elements are equal, which is what the lambda function does (<code>\(x,y) -&gt; x==y</code>). Last, <code>filter</code> gives us only the pairs that satisfy that equality, and <code>map fst</code> gives us the first element of each such pair.</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1">fixpoints xs ys <span class="fu">=</span> map fst <span class="fu">$</span> filter (\(x,y) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> x<span class="fu">==</span>y) <span class="fu">$</span> zip xs ys</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>From this we find that the alphabetic and Dvorak keyboard only have â€˜zâ€™ in the same place. Last, <code>alpha</code> and <code>qwerty</code> have no pairs: no words are the same on both keyboards. We can visualize these correspondences as follows, going clockwise from 90Â°.</p>

<p>For finding â€˜revolving pairsâ€™ between alphabetic and Qwerty, <a href="https://twitter.com/eccehetero/status/1157640471335899138">@eccehetero</a> has already done this in Java (<a href="https://pastebin.com/GZGtydeY">code</a>; <a href="https://pastebin.com/aY9pA8Ya">results</a>). Notably, he points out its similarity to cryptography, such as the Caesar cipher. Since alpha-to-Qwerty translation is taken care of, here Iâ€™d like to experiment with Qwerty-to-Dvorak.</p>
<p>To compare whole words, weâ€™ll need a function to convert from one keyboard to another. Note that this requires functions from the Data.List and Data.Maybe libraries.</p>
<div id="cb3" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">convert xs ys []     <span class="fu">=</span> []</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" data-line-number="2">convert xs ys (z<span class="fu">:</span>zs) <span class="fu">=</span> (toEnum (fromEnum z <span class="fu">+</span> shift)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Char</span>) <span class="fu">:</span> convert xs ys zs</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" data-line-number="3">                        <span class="kw">where</span> kNums <span class="fu">=</span> zipWith (<span class="fu">-</span>) (map fromEnum ys) (map fromEnum xs)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" data-line-number="4">                              shift <span class="fu">=</span> kNums <span class="fu">!!</span> fromJust (elemIndex z xs)</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Our function <code>convert</code> takes two lists â€” the one weâ€™re starting from (<code>xs</code>), and the one we want to convert it to (<code>ys</code>). It also takes a string <code>(z:zs)</code>, where <code>z</code> is the head or first letter of that string. The core idea is just to convert letters to numbers (<code>fromEnum</code>), add a â€˜shiftâ€™ factor, and then convert back to letters (<code>toEnum</code>). We get this shift factor by pairing up letters, converting them to numbers, and subtracting. Then for a given letter <code>z</code> (the <em>n</em>th on the keyboard) we just find the corresponding shift.</p>
<p>To translate key-wise from Qwerty to Dvorak, we can just use <code>map (convert qwerty dvorak) words</code>, where <code>words</code> is a list of strings. One list of 58K words is available <a href="http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, however, <code>convert</code> isnâ€™t super-efficient, since weâ€™re reconstructing this list of shift factors over and over again for each letter. To go through an entire dictionary, itâ€™s better to define this list separately and take it as an argument to the function. This is actually really easy, but less general:</p>
<div id="cb4" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">qwertyToDvorak <span class="fu">=</span> zipWith (<span class="fu">-</span>) (map fromEnum dvorak) (map fromEnum qwerty)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-2" data-line-number="2"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-3" data-line-number="3">convert&#39; xs shifts []     <span class="fu">=</span> []</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-4" data-line-number="4">convert&#39; xs shifts (z<span class="fu">:</span>zs) <span class="fu">=</span> (toEnum (fromEnum z <span class="fu">+</span> shift)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">Char</span>) <span class="fu">:</span> convert&#39; xs shifts zs</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-5" data-line-number="5">                                     <span class="kw">where</span> shift <span class="fu">=</span> shifts <span class="fu">!!</span> fromJust (elemIndex z xs)</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this done, the crucial function to use is the following, which converts the words and then filters out those that arenâ€™t in the dictionary.</p>
<div id="cb5" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1">filter (\word <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> word <span class="ot">`elem`</span> dictionary) <span class="fu">$</span> map (convert&#39; qwerty qwertyToDvorak) dictionary</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>After back-translating the result to Qwerty, we get this list of words, in the format <code>(qwerty,dvorak)</code>:</p>
<p><code>[(&quot;bid&quot;,&quot;wad&quot;),(&quot;bids&quot;,&quot;wadi&quot;),(&quot;bob&quot;,&quot;wow&quot;),(&quot;boo&quot;,&quot;woo&quot;),(&quot;bop&quot;,&quot;woe&quot;),(&quot;cad&quot;,&quot;bud&quot;),(&quot;car&quot;,&quot;bug&quot;),(&quot;caw&quot;,&quot;buy&quot;),(&quot;cob&quot;,&quot;bow&quot;),(&quot;coo&quot;,&quot;boo&quot;),(&quot;copy&quot;,&quot;boer&quot;),(&quot;cor&quot;,&quot;bog&quot;),(&quot;coup&quot;,&quot;bole&quot;),(&quot;cow&quot;,&quot;boy&quot;),(&quot;cox&quot;,&quot;box&quot;),(&quot;dad&quot;,&quot;dud&quot;),(&quot;did&quot;,&quot;dad&quot;),(&quot;do&quot;,&quot;do&quot;),(&quot;dodo&quot;,&quot;dodo&quot;),(&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;dot&quot;),(&quot;doh&quot;,&quot;don&quot;),(&quot;dopy&quot;,&quot;doer&quot;),(&quot;dor&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;),(&quot;dot&quot;,&quot;doc&quot;),(&quot;ear&quot;,&quot;fug&quot;),(&quot;fag&quot;,&quot;hut&quot;),(&quot;far&quot;,&quot;hug&quot;),(&quot;fig&quot;,&quot;hat&quot;),(&quot;fir&quot;,&quot;hag&quot;),(&quot;fob&quot;,&quot;how&quot;),(&quot;fog&quot;,&quot;hot&quot;),(&quot;food&quot;,&quot;hood&quot;),(&quot;fop&quot;,&quot;hoe&quot;),(&quot;for&quot;,&quot;hog&quot;),(&quot;gaga&quot;,&quot;tutu&quot;),(&quot;gig&quot;,&quot;tat&quot;),(&quot;go&quot;,&quot;to&quot;),(&quot;goo&quot;,&quot;too&quot;),(&quot;ha&quot;,&quot;nu&quot;),(&quot;hag&quot;,&quot;nut&quot;),(&quot;hic&quot;,&quot;nab&quot;),(&quot;ho&quot;,&quot;no&quot;),(&quot;hob&quot;,&quot;now&quot;),(&quot;hod&quot;,&quot;nod&quot;),(&quot;hog&quot;,&quot;not&quot;),(&quot;if&quot;,&quot;ah&quot;),(&quot;irish&quot;,&quot;again&quot;),(&quot;jap&quot;,&quot;sue&quot;),(&quot;job&quot;,&quot;sow&quot;),(&quot;jog&quot;,&quot;sot&quot;),(&quot;lag&quot;,&quot;jut&quot;),(&quot;log&quot;,&quot;jot&quot;),(&quot;low&quot;,&quot;joy&quot;),(&quot;moo&quot;,&quot;zoo&quot;),(&quot;odd&quot;,&quot;odd&quot;),(&quot;of&quot;,&quot;oh&quot;),(&quot;oh&quot;,&quot;on&quot;),(&quot;ox&quot;,&quot;ox&quot;),(&quot;pig&quot;,&quot;eat&quot;),(&quot;pro&quot;,&quot;ego&quot;),(&quot;rag&quot;,&quot;gut&quot;),(&quot;raw&quot;,&quot;guy&quot;),(&quot;rid&quot;,&quot;gad&quot;),(&quot;rocs&quot;,&quot;gobi&quot;),(&quot;rod&quot;,&quot;god&quot;),(&quot;roo&quot;,&quot;goo&quot;),(&quot;soh&quot;,&quot;ion&quot;),(&quot;tag&quot;,&quot;cut&quot;),(&quot;tap&quot;,&quot;cue&quot;),(&quot;tic&quot;,&quot;cab&quot;),(&quot;tog&quot;,&quot;cot&quot;),(&quot;too&quot;,&quot;coo&quot;),(&quot;tow&quot;,&quot;coy&quot;),(&quot;toy&quot;,&quot;cor&quot;),(&quot;yap&quot;,&quot;rue&quot;),(&quot;yogi&quot;,&quot;rota&quot;)]</code></p>
<p>This gives 76 words out of 58,110, or 0.13%. Note the prevalence of words featuring â€˜oâ€™ and â€˜dâ€™, our semiotic fixpoints from before. Thereâ€™s nothing too eldritch, Iâ€™m afraid â€” the longest is irish/again. If anyone feels brave, thereâ€™s also a dictionary of 466K words <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words">here</a>, to root out more obscure pairings.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve put my code in a <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Qwernomics">GitHub repository</a>, which includes both 58K-word and 466K-word dictionaries, which can be imported as a module. The code could be improved in a lot of ways â€” notably, it breaks if it encounters a non-alphabetic character, like an apostrophe. Iâ€™d like to come back to it once Iâ€™ve learned more about data structures and parallelism, to see if my poor laptop can handle 466K words. The repo also has Ti<em>k</em>Z code for the diagrams in this post, which may be fun to experiment with. The arcs below are inspired by a much prettier version by <a href="http://www.xenosystems.net/qwernomics">Amy Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="forbidden-keyboards">Forbidden Keyboards</h3>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://twitter.com/8051Enthusiast/status/1279802890618626049">@8051Enthusiast</a> pointed out that changing from Qwerty to Dvorak is a permutation operation that can be repeated to give a DvorakÂ² â€” far more powerful than mere DvorakÂ¹.</p>
<p>All we need for this is to iterate our <code>convert</code> function from before. In <code>convert qwerty dvorak qwerty</code>, the first two arguments create a permutation from the Qwerty keyboard to a Dvorak keyboard, while the third argument (<code>qwerty</code> again) uses the whole Qwerty keyboard as material. Thus, to get Dvorak-squared, we can just do <code>convert qwerty dvorak (convert qwerty dvorak qwerty)</code>.</p>
<p>This gives the keys <code>&quot;erhtbgjuofladncvipsqxwzymk&quot;</code>, and the following diagram shows clearly that these permutations are the same.</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/qwerty-dvorak-dvorak2-big.png" />
</center>
<p>We can write this in a more sophisticated way using the <code>iterate</code> function, which repeats the <code>convert</code> operation as many times as we want.</p>
<div id="cb6" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">forbiddenDvorak n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="fu">|</span> (n<span class="fu">&lt;=</span><span class="dv">0</span>)    <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert dvorak qwerty) dvorak <span class="fu">!!</span> (abs n <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert qwerty dvorak) dvorak <span class="fu">!!</span> (n<span class="fu">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Thus we can get Dvorak-cubed, up to any power <code>n</code> that we want. Notice that Iâ€™ve included the case where <code>n</code> is less than zero. This acts as an inverse function, or the reverse permutation (here from Dvorak back to Qwerty).</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/dvorak-inverse.png" />
</center>
<p>Perhaps the most curious aspect is that if we keep iterating our function, weâ€™ll eventually get back to where we started. We can check this by creating a list of Dvorak<sup>n</sup> keyboards for increasingly higher powers, and seeing if any besides the first are the same as Dvorak. (The <code>fmap (+2)</code> is because indexing starts at zero, plus weâ€™re excluding DvorakÂ¹ = Dvorak.)</p>
<div id="cb7" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb7-1" data-line-number="1">fmap (<span class="fu">+</span><span class="dv">2</span>) <span class="fu">$</span> elemIndex dvorak <span class="fu">$</span> map forbiddenDvorak [<span class="dv">2</span><span class="fu">..</span><span class="dv">250</span>]</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This outputs <code>Just 211</code>, and as we can plug in and confirm, <code>forbiddenDvorak 211</code> gives the Dvorak keyboard. You can likewise confirm that <code>forbiddenDvorak 210</code> gives Qwerty, which of course follows.</p>
<p>We can make an analogous function permuting alphabetical order into Qwerty:</p>
<div id="cb8" class="sourceCode">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-1" data-line-number="1">forbiddenQwerty n</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-2" data-line-number="2">  <span class="fu">|</span> (n<span class="fu">&lt;=</span><span class="dv">0</span>)    <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert qwerty alpha) qwerty <span class="fu">!!</span> (abs n <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb8-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="fu">|</span> otherwise <span class="fu">=</span> iterate (convert alpha qwerty) qwerty <span class="fu">!!</span> (n<span class="fu">-</span><span class="dv">1</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This one cycles after only 42 iterations. If the obvious association just came to mind, thatâ€™s a taste of the mix between wild coincidence and transcendental conspiracy that defines CCRU humour.</p>
<p>As an exercise, make a <code>forbiddenAlpha</code> function that converts from alphabetic to Dvorak. This one also has a cycle â€” itâ€™s quite a bit larger than 250, but itâ€™s there, and you can find it on your laptop.</p>
<p>I know very little about abstract algebra, but this opens up numerous interesting questions. I didnâ€™t include punctuation for each keyboard layout, but how would these cycles change if we added it? Why does <code>forbiddenQwerty</code> cycle so much sooner than the others, and is there a metric to measure how â€˜closeâ€™ a permutation is? Last, I canâ€™t help but wonder if this group-theoretic structure is an artifact of our simple example, or whether it can be found in more complex sign-systems.</p>

<h3 id="qwerno-materialism">Qwerno-materialism</h3>
<p>For Le (2019: 100-1), qwernomics represents how â€œthe demands of capital accumulation led the technology of the keyboard to develop down a de-anthropomorphising path from which we could not diverge.â€ That is, assuming Qwertyâ€™s inferiority, companiesâ€™ myopic refusal to train their workers in a better typographic system is â€œexemplary of technocapitalismâ€™s way of locking us into a trajectory that will ultimately dehumanise us.â€ (Though dehumanization isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing!) While this may be a fair reading of Landâ€™s original essay, in light of his 2016 lectures itâ€™s far too glib.</p>
<p>Consider Nash equilibrium, where no agent can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. It may be, as in the Prisonerâ€™s dilemma, that if all players changed their strategy, all could benefit, but none can on their own. Conversely, qwernomics presents a situation where any one player can unilaterally benefit from changing their strategy (e.g. a firm switching from Qwerty to Dvorak), but the societal transaction costs are so large that â€” across different games â€” they nullify this advantage.</p>
<p>This parallels the notion of patchwork, where normally a larger country is more efficient due to economies of scale, but now the transaction costs associated with large political institutions are so immense as to outweigh all these benefits, so on net itâ€™s more efficient just to have a smaller state.</p>
<p>Choosing a keyboard is a non-ergodic process, in that we cannot freely wander through the space of possibilities toward a global optimum, where Qwerty has come out best from untrammeled market experimentation. An ergodic process tends toward a fixpoint or equilibrium, while non-ergodic systems do not, but exhibit path dependency, where states far in the past can influence states far into the future. Land perceptively notes that this division of ergodic versus non-ergodic is similar to molar (tending toward an average) versus molecular (centrifugally tending away from an average).</p>
<p>If Qwerty represents a â€˜market solutionâ€™, Dvorak represents â€˜rational planningâ€™ from top-down. Yet, we can also imagine a centrally-planned society unwilling to escape from Qwerty lock-in, where the benefits of Dvorak are judged as not worth the cost of retraining and retooling. Thus, qwernomics is not limited to this simple opposition of interventionism versus spontaneity. In either system, transaction costs have built up over time, so that Qwerty becomes a self-installing law.</p>
<p>Just as Keynesian economics claims that markets get stuck in a low-employment equilibrium, which we can identify from a superior frame, we want to know by what criteria we could evaluate our path as suboptimal from a rational, Archimedean point. Ergonomics seems like the best candidate for Qwerty, but is that all a keyboard really is? The deeper notion here is that a Schelling point â€” an arbitrary but handy standard, like driving on the right side of the road â€” creates the possibility space by which we can retroactively judge it. At a certain point, the standard consumes the horizon.</p>
<p>As another example, Land explicitly compares Qwertyâ€™s hegemony to that of decimal numeracy, and some mathematicians claim octal numbers are superior. Conversely, vestigial tails are evocative, but key to qwernomics is plasticity of agentsâ€™ behaviour: theyâ€™re free to use a different keyboard if they want to, but donâ€™t â€” rather than having a suboptimal state biologically baked into them.</p>
<p>Thus, the main flaw in Leâ€™s account is workersâ€™ lack of agency. Moreover, instead of emphasizing suboptimality as â€˜dehumanizingâ€™, Landâ€™s main interest is in Qwerty as a causal loop, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop">bootstrap paradox</a> in time travel. Qwerty as a code represents a radically alien form of immanence: it is authoritative because it has made itself occur.</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/qwernomic-decoding.png" />
</center>
<h3 id="stratoanalysis">Stratoanalysis</h3>
<p>Land goes on to use the Qwerty keyboard as a hermeneutic device to understand Deleuze &amp; Guattariâ€™s â€œGeology of Moralsâ€. There, stratoanalysis is introduced as a synonym for D&amp;Gâ€™s project, alongside rhizomatics, nomadology, schizoanalysis, pragmatics, and so on. In general, stratoanalysis is very seldom invoked, but itâ€™s actually quite rich as a framework.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the world is made up of relatively autonomous codes, such as the genetic code versus body language. The system of oppositions that defines a code takes place on an independent layer or stratum. Strata interact horizontally via <em>parastrata</em> (codes presupposed by another code of the same order, such as the prison system and legal system) â€” or vertically via <em>epistrata</em> (codes presupposed by another code of a different order, such as the legal system relying on language, biochemistry, and so on). An example of parastrata in Qwerty is using keys in a game for movement.</p>
<p>A keyboard lends itself as a paradigmatic example because it combines so many forms of code, at so many levels. There are linguistic codes (letters in English words), physical codes (limitations of human hands), and mechanical codes (technical specifications). Further, a keyboard embodies various semiotic distinctions, such as code vs. territory or form vs. substance. Qwerty takes the alphabet out of its â€˜territoryâ€™, as ordered in the ABCs song; likewise, the fingers of the typist are deterritorialized onto the keyboard. In this sense, Qwerty is an abstract diagram of stratification.</p>
<p>While typical semiotics deals with signifiers and signifieds, Deleuze &amp; Guattari draw from Hjelmslevâ€™s quadripartition. In a verbal language, expression-substance is the continuum of sounds producible by the human vocal apparatus; expression-form is its differentiation into phonemes (signifiers); content-substance is sphere of concepts; and content-form is its differentiation into signifieds [<a href="http://enl.auth.gr/gramma/gramma12/B.2.pdf">via</a>].</p>
<p>Analogously, if substance is the physical aspect, then a physical keyboard is content-substance, while Qwerty is an expression-substance. Likewise, the expression-form is the signifier being typed, while content-form is the signified. (Donâ€™t quote me on this, Iâ€™m sure I mangled it.) The main point is that variations such as Azerty keyboards for Francophones can be localized onto one of these planes.</p>
<p>Therefore, more broadly, qwernomics is an analysis of stratification or capture, as Qwerty directs codesâ€™ flows of intensities. Audaciously, we can say that qwerty is a cultural genome, with knowledge geologically deposited into it. By way of a quasi-diagrammatic analysis of the keyboard through stratograms, we can hack the cryptographic protocol that the qwerty apocalypse has delivered to us.</p>

<h3 id="the-extreme-qwernomic-thesis">The Extreme Qwernomic Thesis</h3>
<p>If all this sounds increasingly weird, then good. It gets weirder.</p>
<p>Above I stressed qwernomicsâ€™ skepticism towards global criteria for optimality, and we can radicalize this still further. One form has shown up in empirical studies: that even prior to Qwerty there was already a pool of typing competence that settled the arrangement of Qwerty. Hence, Qwerty has no localizable origin, and the entire geopolitical structure of world history is Qwerty-shaped.</p>
<p>Thus the â€˜extreme qwernomic thesisâ€™ can perhaps be most cogently stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
the highly obscure historical stratodynamic process from which we have inherited the keyboard is the same process that has provided us with all the cognitive resources that we could conceivably gain access [to] in investigating our object&quot; [2016, VII, around 41:00]
</blockquote>
<p>We can restate this in various other ways. (Iâ€™m mostly just plagiarizing Land here.)</p>
<p>The core idea is that of an immanent cognitive horizon: if qwerty is the machine talking about itself, there is no meta-discourse on the machine that weâ€™re ever going to find. There is no position of purchase or overview or superior perspective, because the function of overviewing is itself a product of a stratic mechanism, a symptom of stratic embeddedness. Hence there is no <em>possible</em> that isnâ€™t already within the processing system. The overview position itself is structured inside that strata.</p>
<p>Qwerty is the revelation of a transcendental cognitive engine, in that the cognitive machinery we are trying to put into play has to come out of our object. Faced with the immanence of all criteria, there is no way out, but only through â€” mining parts of the keyboard for parts of our theory, in the form of â€œdelirialized, wild particles of conceptionâ€ such as the <code>Ctrl</code> key as zone of transference between dimensional systems, or Qabbalistic resonances of the <code>Esc</code> key. The purpose of these schizoid parts of qwernomics is to explore the extent to which qwerty is a transcendental cognitive resource.</p>
<center>
<img src="../static/img/blog-posts/qwernomic-territory.png" />
</center>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Most of these statements sound absurd when applied to the keyboard, but the same considerations come into play for concrete problems where we donâ€™t have nearly as much of a conceptual foothold.</p>
<p>The ultimate stakes of qwernomics are to delineate the meaning of a â€˜critiqueâ€™ of capitalism, in the Kantian sense of a global tribunal of reason. Many people will be sympathetic to the notion that there is no such universal position; yet, even by calling something a local optimum at all, weâ€™re already implying the existence of some position of transcendent criticism. At a bare minimum, qwernomics makes us aware of the â€˜spectre of the universalâ€™ by which we criticize standards.</p>
<p>While I still havenâ€™t digested all this, it seems that simulation offers an interesting counterpoint. Instead of looking at our path from some external position and saying it was wrong, simulations immanently generate a multiplicity of paths to which we can compare our own. We donâ€™t need an Archimedean point, but only to differentiate the various strata as manifested in parameters that can undergo variations. Instead of a global perspective, we generate a garden of forking paths to populate the search space with purely local theories. This seems entirely compatible with the points made above. In a word, we can radicalize qwernomics still further into computational stratoanalysis.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beyond its 140-character limit, Twitterâ€™s next most-prominent feature is its linearity, chronologically posting tweets that gradually sink into the memory hole. Twitterâ€™s algorithms have tried to shake up its temporal structure, but as <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePatanoiac/status/1155701114626383874">some</a> have pointed out, this tends to drown out less-known authors.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://twitter.com/gjncs/moments">Moments</a>. Moments are like eavesdropping on hundreds of conversations at precisely the most interesting point. As opposed to obtrusive tweetstorms based on searching a keyword (as I did in my early days, riffing off <a href="https://twitter.com/youtopos">@youtopos</a>), Moments provide a handy cubbyhole for tweets you want to return to later, whether 10 years old or 10 minutes. Itâ€™s the closest you can get to meta-tweeting.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m obviously what programmers call an â€˜edge caseâ€™ here â€” someone who uses a software feature in a way the programmer never anticipated. Yet, an interesting mathematical fact is that in an <em>n</em>-dimensional hypercube, most of the volume occurs at the edges, unlike with 2 or 3 dimensions <a href="https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1259191868509863937">(h/t)</a>. This is precisely the â€˜pataphysical space that programmers occupy, where the exception is the rule.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve made 481 Moments, mostly on philosophy or math. My favorite aspect is how they encompass a mosaic of often contradictory perspectives on the same concept â€” heteroglossia. Scouring twitter is also a surprisingly effective way to get the core of an idea, shorn of all unneeded verbosity. Last, itâ€™s a backstage pass to the <em>lore</em> of a (sub-sub-)discipline, like the deep grad school conversations that I never got to have, or the mysterious origins of zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms.</p>
<p>After Twitterâ€™s last major upgrade, I used an app to keep the old layout, which had a simple button for adding tweets to a Moment. On June 1, Twitter removed support for this. In short, itâ€™s an order of magnitude more difficult to make them, so I have little choice but to move on. Still, I deserved any flack I got for curating other peopleâ€™s ideas instead of my own, and now plan to blog more instead.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites came from conferences, compiling reams of hyper-erudite thought-crystals. (Though Iâ€™m told these authors optimized precisely for pithy tweets â€” rather than, say, substance.)</p>

<p>For the rest, even the titles alone give an evocative bestiary of avant-garde ideas. I certainly canâ€™t claim to have my own â€˜takeâ€™ on each of these, but Iâ€™ve at least tried to understand them from many angles, like a Cubist painting. Itâ€™s fun and informative just to go through the list and see how many you can rattle through, and for someone hoping to learn, these provide digestable sound-bytes spanning the spectrum from gadfly-bites to perspective-changing insights.</p>

<p>Beyond its 140-character limit, Twitterâ€™s next most-prominent feature is its linearity, chronologically posting tweets that gradually sink into the memory hole. Twitterâ€™s algorithms have tried to shake up its temporal structure, but as <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePatanoiac/status/1155701114626383874">some</a> have pointed out, this tends to drown out less-known authors.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://twitter.com/gjncs/moments">Moments</a>. Moments are like eavesdropping on hundreds of conversations at precisely the most interesting point. As opposed to obtrusive tweetstorms based on searching a keyword (as I did in my early days, riffing off <a href="https://twitter.com/youtopos">@youtopos</a>), Moments provide a handy cubbyhole for tweets you want to return to later, whether 10 years old or 10 minutes. Itâ€™s the closest you can get to meta-tweeting.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m obviously what programmers call an â€˜edge caseâ€™ here â€” someone who uses a software feature in a way the programmer never anticipated. Yet, an interesting mathematical fact is that in an <em>n</em>-dimensional hypercube, most of the volume occurs at the edges, unlike with 2 or 3 dimensions <a href="https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1259191868509863937">(h/t)</a>. This is precisely the â€˜pataphysical space that programmers occupy, where the exception is the rule.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve made 481 Moments, mostly on philosophy or math. My favorite aspect is how they encompass a mosaic of often contradictory perspectives on the same concept â€” heteroglossia. Scouring twitter is also a surprisingly effective way to get the core of an idea, shorn of all unneeded verbosity. Last, itâ€™s a backstage pass to the <em>lore</em> of a (sub-sub-)discipline, like the deep grad school conversations that I never got to have, or the mysterious origins of zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms.</p>
<p>After Twitterâ€™s last major upgrade, I used an app to keep the old layout, which had a simple button for adding tweets to a Moment. On June 1, Twitter removed support for this. In short, itâ€™s an order of magnitude more difficult to make them, so I have little choice but to move on. Still, I deserved any flack I got for curating other peopleâ€™s ideas instead of my own, and now plan to blog more instead.</p>
<p>Some of my favorites came from conferences, compiling reams of hyper-erudite thought-crystals. (Though Iâ€™m told these authors optimized precisely for pithy tweets â€” rather than, say, substance.)</p>
