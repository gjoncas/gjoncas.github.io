oneironomics (n.) - the economics of dreams
<br><br>

We have been sold this lie: that quantitative is the opposite of qualitative.

In some of the most singular products of human creativity we find a methodical reliance on numerical patterns, 
entirely at variance with archetypes of *ex nihilo* ‘inspiration’. 
We can trace within Leonardo Da Vinci’s paintings a recurring spiral that corresponds implicitly to the Fibonacci sequence, 
and recent philological inquiry reveals chains of nested numerical rings in Latin poetry from Horace to Virgil—metrical and thematic symmetries embedded, 
for instance, from “lines 1.4 to 3.28, 1.5 to 3.26, and so on and on” throughout Horace’s *Odes*, permitting arithmetic theorems and lemmas that provide 
“precise, numerical, thorough, crushingly persuasive” insights into how the Romans thought (McCloskey, 1998: 70-1); mathematical motifs similarly pervade 
modern literature from Lewis Carroll’s surrealist allegories to [David Foster Wallace](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKCMTHX5WHk)’s organization of 
*Infinite Jest* in the form of a Sierpinski gasket.

The point here is **not** to ascribe some ‘inherent’ beauty to numerical patterns, which misses the fundamental point: 
by imposing on themselves entirely arbitrary constraints, these artists forced themselves to **think harder**. 
Quantitative rigor *brings forth* qualitative expression. 
If, faced with the task of explaining an unexplainable world, this was all economics had to offer, it would be more than enough. 
That is, even *denying* its ideas—Nash equilibrium, cointegration, and beyond—any referential content, economic formalism offers something *more*, 
something irreducible to one narrative among others. Yet if we suppose, for the sake of argument, that these recondite formulas are meaningful in 
a way closely tied to their numerical form rather than in spite of it, then our story becomes more interesting still. 
This is the just the tip of the iceberg.
